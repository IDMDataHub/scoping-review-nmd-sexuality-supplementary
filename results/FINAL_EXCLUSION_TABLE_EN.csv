6191009,1983,"X-linked adult form of spinal muscular atrophy.","INCLUDE","INCLUDED. In this article, sexual and reproductive aspects are addressed mainly within the systemic endocrine phenotype of SBMA, in keeping with partial androgen insensitivity despite usually normal serum testosterone levels. Reported manifestations include gynecomastia as a frequent sign of androgen resistance, as well as reproductive abnormalities such as reduced fertility related to testicular atrophy and impaired spermatogenesis (including oligospermia or azoospermia). Sexual function may also be affected, with erectile dysfunction and reduced libido described as part of the non-neurological symptom spectrum. Importantly, these elements are presented as clinical features of endocrine involvement rather than a detailed assessment of patients' sexual life or psychosocial sexuality."
25356310,2014,"The relationship between sexual function and quality of sleep in caregiving mothers of sons with duchenne muscular dystrophy.","EXCLUDE","This study focuses on the sexual function of caregiving mothers of sons with DMD, not on patients with NMD themselves. The population studied (caregivers) does not meet the inclusion criteria which require data on individuals affected by neuromuscular diseases."
8789451,1996,"Deletions in Xq28 in two boys with myotubular myopathy and abnormal genital development define a new contiguous gene syndrome in a 430 kb region.","EXCLUDE","This genetic study describes a contiguous gene syndrome involving abnormal genital development (malformation) in boys with myotubular myopathy due to Xq28 deletions. The genital abnormalities reported are developmental/congenital malformations, not sexual dysfunction. No data on sexual function or sexuality are provided."
38162906,2024,"Non-motor symptoms in motor neuron disease: prevalence, assessment and impact.","EXCLUDE","Although sexual dysfunction is listed among the 11 non-motor symptoms explored in this population-based study of 120 MND patients, the abstract does not provide specific prevalence data, assessment details, or characterization of sexual dysfunction. The study focuses on the overall burden of non-motor symptoms rather than providing detailed analysis of sexual health."
23776379,2012,"Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy: current and emerging treatment options for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.","EXCLUDE","This is a treatment review article for TTR-FAP. Erectile dysfunction is briefly mentioned as one symptom of autonomic neuropathy in the clinical description, but no original data on sexual dysfunction prevalence, assessment, or outcomes are provided. The focus is on therapeutic strategies, not sexual health."
20143571,2009,"[Familial transthyretin amyloidosis].","EXCLUDE","This case report is published in Russian (Klinicheskaia meditsina), which does not meet the language inclusion criteria (English or French). Additionally, erectile dysfunction is mentioned only as one symptom among others in the clinical description of autonomic polyneuropathy, without detailed assessment."
19078586,2000,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy and glycerol kinase deficiency: a rare contiguous gene syndrome.","EXCLUDE","This article describes a contiguous gene syndrome (DMD + glycerol kinase deficiency + adrenal hypoplasia). The mention of 'sexual ambiguity' relates to adrenal hypoplasia congenita affecting genital development, not to sexual dysfunction in NMD patients. No data on sexual function are provided."
22389795,2011,"Patient preference assessment reveals disease aspects not covered by recommended outcomes in polymyositis and dermatomyositis.","EXCLUDE","This study evaluates patient preferences for disability outcomes in PM/DM using the MACTAR questionnaire. Although sexuality may be mentioned as a potential domain, no specific data on sexual dysfunction prevalence or characteristics are reported. The focus is on patient-reported outcome priorities, not sexual health assessment."
36339574,2022,"Synergistic association of resveratrol and histone deacetylase inhibitors as treatment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","EXCLUDE","This article reviews potential therapeutic effects of resveratrol and histone deacetylase inhibitors in ALS. No content related to sexual function or sexuality is present. The focus is entirely on neuroprotective treatment strategies."
32707986,2020,"Predictors of Depression in Caucasian Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Romania.","EXCLUDE","This study investigates predictors of depression in ALS patients using Beck Depression Inventory. While depression may indirectly affect sexuality, no specific data on sexual function are reported. The study focuses on mood disorders, not sexual health."
32377479,2020,"Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type I Associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Syndrome: Immunopathological Aspects and Treatment Options.","EXCLUDE","This article discusses HTLV-I virus association with ALS. The term 'sexual' appears only in the context of viral transmission routes, not sexual dysfunction. No data on sexual function in patients are provided."
30069287,2018,"Allgrove syndrome and motor neuron disease.","EXCLUDE","This case report describes Allgrove syndrome with motor neuron disease features. No data on sexual function are reported. The focus is on the neurological phenotype and diagnosis of this rare syndrome."
32232748,2020,"Impact of Non-Cardiac Clinicopathologic Characteristics on Survival in Transthyretin Amyloid Polyneuropathy.","EXCLUDE","This study analyzes non-cardiac factors affecting survival in transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy. No data on sexual function are reported. The focus is on prognostic factors and survival outcomes."
31583185,2019,"Carpal tunnel syndrome and associated symptoms as first manifestation of hATTR amyloidosis.","EXCLUDE","This article describes carpal tunnel syndrome as an early manifestation of hATTR amyloidosis. No content related to sexual function or sexuality is present. The focus is on early diagnostic features."
