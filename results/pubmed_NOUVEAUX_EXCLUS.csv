39636620,"Real-world safety evaluation of atorvastatin: insights from the US FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS).","Wan H; Xu X; Yi D; Shuai K","Expert opinion on drug safety",2025,"OBJECTIVE: Given the extensive use of atorvastatin in managing cardiovascular conditions and the surge in reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs), this study leverages the FAERS database to comprehensively evaluate atorvastatin-associated adverse events, thereby enhancing our understanding of its safety profile in real-world settings. METHODS: A retrospective observational pharmacovigilance study was conducted using FAERS data from Q1 2004 to Q1 2024. Four algorithms - ROR, PRR, BCPNN, and EBGM - were employed to detect signals of adverse events (AEs) linked to atorvastatin through disproportionality analysis. RESULTS: Out of 17,627,340 reports in the FAERS database 81,955 involved atorvastatin. Consistently identified AEs across all four algorithms included musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, metabolic and nutritional disorders, and hepatobiliary disorders at the system organ class (SOC) level. A total of 4,575 significant disproportionate preferred terms (PTs) were observed across 23 SOCs, with key PTs being 'immune-mediated myositis,' 'type 2 diabetes mellitus,' 'necrotizing myositis,' 'autoimmune myositis,' and 'myopathy.' Additionally, unexpected AEs such as erectile dysfunction were identified. The median onset time for these AEs was 60 days, with most occurring within the first 30 days of treatment. CONCLUSION: This study identified both expected and unexpected AEs associated with atorvastatin, highlighting the need for continued surveillance and providing valuable insights for clinicians to optimize atorvastatin use and address safety concerns.","10.1080/14740338.2024.2424438","Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Humans; Atorvastatin; Pharmacovigilance; Retrospective Studies; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Female; Databases, Factual; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Young Adult; Adolescent; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions","Atorvastatin; FAERS; Statins; adverse event; pharmacovigilance","Journal Article; Observational Study"

Herein, we present a case of a 10-year-old girl with Down's syndrome, short stature, and vitiligo who presented to our hospital with vaginal bleeding and a palpable pelvic mass. Upon ultrasound and topographical examination, bilateral ovarian masses with negative tumor markers were detected. After bilateral gonadectomy, endocrine studies revealed profound hypothyroidism and peripheral puberty that led to the VWGS syndrome diagnosis (TSH 367.3 mUI/mL, isolated menstruation, indetectable LH, and elevated estradiol). Levothyroxine treatment improved obesity and short stature, and sexual hormone replacement began at 13 years of age. The literature on Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome shows that it presents most often in women, and classic hypothyroidism symptoms always precede the diagnosis. Approximately 11% of patients have Down's syndrome, sometimes tumor markers are elevated, and some develop severe symptoms (myopathy, short stature, mental delay, ascites, pericardial effusion, Cullen's sign, pituitary hyperplasia, and severe anemia) that respond to levothyroxine treatment. Conclusions: Children with peripheral precocious puberty and gonadal masses must be studied for hypothyroidism before any radical decision is made.","10.3390/children11070831","","Van Wyk–Grumbach syndrome; gonadectomy; ovarian cysts; precocious; puberty","Case Reports; Journal Article"
36966027,"Review: Current challenges in poultry nutrition, health, and welfare.","Korver DR","Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience",2023,"The poultry industry has benefited greatly from advances in genetics, nutrition, housing and management strategies. Geneticists have made welfare and health traits important components of selection programs, and in general, modern, high-producing poultry are healthier than 30 years ago. However, increased productivity means that the birds are closer to their physiological limits, and nutrition, environment and management have become increasingly important. The move away from in-feed antibiotic growth promotors has resulted in challenges in maintaining gut health and consequently, bird performance. However, as the industry adapts to production without the use of antibiotic growth promotors, long-term benefits may be realized due to a reduction in antimicrobial resistance. Intensive selection for meat yield and efficiency are associated with an increased risk of muscle myopathies that affect bird health and meat quality. As genetic selection increased broiler production traits, it became necessary to restrict parent stock nutrient intake in order to prevent excessive muscle and fat deposition, reduce metabolic disease, and maintain ovarian control. With continued selection for broiler production traits, the degree of restriction implemented has become a welfare issue. Additionally, recent research suggests that highly efficient broiler lines may have limited fat deposition and therefore energy reserves to support sexual maturation and egg production, especially if typical broiler breeder BW targets are maintained. A re-examination of broiler breeder feeding programs is necessary to maintain productivity and welfare. Modern laying hens are capable of laying cycles in excess of 100 weeks of age. This has reduced the use of stress-inducing forced molting programs and reduces the total number of hens needed to meet the demand for egg production. The important role of the skeletal system in eggshell deposition demands that skeletal development during rearing be carefully managed to avoid shell and skeletal problems at the end of the production cycle. As the production potential of modern poultry continues to increase through genetic and genomic selection, even greater care must be paid in order to maintain bird health and welfare. The poultry industry has successfully faced many challenges in the past and is likely to overcome the existing challenges as well.","10.1016/j.animal.2023.100755","Animals; Female; Poultry; Chickens; Ovum; Nutritional Status; Eating","Broiler chicken; Challenges and opportunities; Laying hen; Metabolic limits; Production efficiency","Journal Article; Review"

Chromosome karyotype G-banding analysis of the proband showed a 46,XX karyotype, but B-ultrasound analysis demonstrated the existence of scrotum, testis and penis which inferred a male sexual differentiation. Aneuploidy and copy number variation (CNV) detection by low-coverage single-end whole genome sequencing (WGS) revealed a de novo SRY (sex-determining region Y) gene positive fragment of 224.34 kb length (chrY:2,649,472-2,873,810) which explained the gonadal/genital-chromosomal inconsistency in the proband. Additionally, targeted-region-capture-based DMD gene sequencing and Sanger verification confirmed a widely reported pathogenic heterozygous nonsense mutation (NM_004006, c.9100C>T, p.Arg3034Ter) in the dystrophin-coding gene named DMD. This study emphasizes that integrated analyses of the imaging results, cytogenetics, and molecular features can play an important role in prenatal diagnosis. It requires the combination of more detection techniques with higher resolution than karyotyping to determine the genetic and biological sex of fetuses in prenatal diagnosis. To conclusively determine both the biological and genetic sex of the fetus at the time of prenatal diagnosis particularly in cases that involve X-linked conditions is of vital importance, which would crucially influence the decision-making regarding abortions. This study will help in prenatal diagnosis of DMD in future, also providing a new perspective that enables the genetic diagnosis of sex reversal in pregnancy. Moreover, genetic counseling/analysis for early diagnosis and pre-symptom interventions are warranted.","10.3389/fgene.2019.01350","","46,XX testicular DSD; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; genetic counseling; integrated analyses; prenatal","Case Reports; Journal Article"

Here, we have described a novel 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis syndrome caused by homozygous variants in PPP2R3C gene. This gene encodes B″gamma regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the phospho-regulation processes of most mammalian cell types. PPP2R3C gene is most abundantly expressed in testis in humans, while its function was hitherto unknown. Patients and methods Four girls from four unrelated families with 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis were studied using exome or Sanger sequencing of PPP2R3C gene. In total, four patients and their heterozygous parents were investigated for clinical, laboratory, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics. Results We have identified three different homozygous PPP2R3C variants, c.308T>C (p.L103P), c.578T>C (p.L193S) and c.1049T>C (p.F350S), in four girls with 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis. Patients also manifested a unique syndrome of extragonadal anomalies, including typical facial gestalt, low birth weight, myopathy, rod and cone dystrophy, anal atresia, omphalocele, sensorineural hearing loss, dry and scaly skin, skeletal abnormalities, renal agenesis and neuromotor delay. We have shown a decreased SOX9-Phospho protein expression in the dysgenetic gonads of the patients with homozygous PPP2R3C variants suggesting impaired SOX9 signaling in the pathogenesis of gonadal dysgenesis. Heterozygous males presented with abnormal sperm morphology and impaired fertility. Conclusion Our findings suggest that PPP2R3C protein is involved in the ontogeny of multiple organs, especially critical for testis development and spermatogenesis. PPPR3C provides insight into pathophysiology, as well as emerging as a potential therapeutic target for male infertility.","10.1530/EJE-19-0067","Adult; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Child; Child, Preschool; Congenital Abnormalities; Consanguinity; Female; Gonadal Dysgenesis, 46,XY; Homozygote; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Molecular; Mutation; Mutation, Missense; Pedigree; Phenotype; Protein Phosphatase 2; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; SOX9 Transcription Factor; Spermatogenesis; Syndrome; Testis","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

Diabetes & endocrinology",2016,"Cushing's syndrome is a serious endocrine disease caused by chronic, autonomous, and excessive secretion of cortisol. The syndrome is associated with increased mortality and impaired quality of life because of the occurrence of comorbidities. These clinical complications include metabolic syndrome, consisting of systemic arterial hypertension, visceral obesity, impairment of glucose metabolism, and dyslipidaemia; musculoskeletal disorders, such as myopathy, osteoporosis, and skeletal fractures; neuropsychiatric disorders, such as impairment of cognitive function, depression, or mania; impairment of reproductive and sexual function; and dermatological manifestations, mainly represented by acne, hirsutism, and alopecia. Hypertension in patients with Cushing's syndrome has a multifactorial pathogenesis and contributes to the increased risk for myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, or stroke, which are the most common causes of death; risks of these outcomes are exacerbated by a prothrombotic diathesis and hypokalaemia. Neuropsychiatric disorders can be responsible for suicide. Immune disorders are common; immunosuppression during active disease causes susceptibility to infections, possibly complicated by sepsis, an important cause of death, whereas immune rebound after disease remission can exacerbate underlying autoimmune diseases. Prompt treatment of cortisol excess and specific treatments of comorbidities are crucial to prevent serious clinical complications and reduce the mortality associated with Cushing's syndrome.","10.1016/S2213-8587(16)00086-3","Cardiovascular Diseases; Cushing Syndrome; Humans; Immune System Diseases; Mental Disorders; Metabolic Syndrome; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological","","Journal Article; Review"
25548543,"Erectile Dysfunction and Essential Hypertension: The Same Aging-related Disorder?","Clavijo RI; Miner MM; Rajfer J","Reviews in urology",2014,"An erection is a mechanical event dependent primarily on corporeal vascular dynamics wherein arterial inflow and storage of blood within the corpora is greater than the egress of blood from the corpora. The most common cause of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability of the corporal tissue to store the blood within the corporal sinusoids once inflow into the corpora begins. This failure to store is primarily due to a corporal smooth muscle dysfunction and, in most men, is most likely an aging-related occurrence. Because the corporal smooth muscle is embryologically and physiologically indistinguishable from the smooth muscle within our arterial system, the authors hypothesize that the aging-related dysfunction that occurs within the penis also occurs within the arterial system, and that this smooth muscle dysfunction within the arterial media is most likely the cause of what is called essential hypertension. This panvascular smooth muscle myopathy could explain why hypertension is the most common comorbidity associated with ED and appears to indicate that both ED and essential hypertension are the same disorder, albeit in two different organ systems.",NA,"","Endothelium; Erection; Hypertension; Smooth muscle","Journal Article"

But they also possess several adverse effects like myopathy with elevation of hepatic transaminases (>3 times the upper limit of normal) or creatine kinase (>10 times the upper limit of normal) and some rare side-effects, including peripheral neuropathy, memory loss, sleep disturbances, and erectile dysfunction. Due to these adverse effects, patients abruptly withdrew statins without consulting physicians. This abrupt discontinuation of statins is termed as statin intolerance. Statin-induced myopathy constitutes two third of all side-effects from statins and is the primary reason for statin intolerance. Though statin intolerance has considerably impacted cardiovascular outcomes in the high-risk patients, it has been well effectively managed by prescribing statins either as alternate-day or once weekly dosage regimen, as combination therapy with a non-statin therapy or and by dietary intervention.

We applied a reproductive control program to a population of eastern grey kangaroos confined to a golf course in South East Queensland. The program aimed to reduce fecundity sufficiently for the population to decrease over time so that overgrazing of the fairways and the frequency of human-animal conflict situations were minimised. In 2003, 92% of the female kangaroos above 5 kg bodyweight were implanted with the GnRH agonist deslorelin after darting with a dissociative anaesthetic. In 2007, 86% of the females above 5 kg were implanted with deslorelin and also 87% of the males above 5 kg were sterilised by either orchidectomy or vasectomy. In 2005, 2008 and 2009, the population was censused to assess the effect of each treatment. The 2003 deslorelin program resulted in effective zero population growth for approximately 2.5 years. The combined deslorelin-surgery program in 2007 reduced the birth rate from 0.3 to 0.06%/year for 16 months, resulting in a 27% population reduction by November 2009. The results were consistent with implants conferring contraception to 100% of implanted females for at least 12 months. The iatrogenic mortality rates for each program were 10.5% and 4.9%, respectively, with 50% of all mortalities due to darting-related injuries, exertional myopathy/hyperthermia or recovery misadventure. The short term sexual and agonistic behaviour of the males was assessed for the 2007 program: no significant changes were seen in adult males given the vasectomy procedure, while sexual behaviours' were decreased in adult males given the orchidectomy procedure. It is concluded that female reproduction was effectively controlled by implantation with deslorrelin and male reproductive behaviour was reduced by orchidectomy, which together achieved population control.","10.3390/ani4030562","","Deslorelin; behaviour; orchidectomy; vasectomy; welfare","Journal Article"

This report provides the first documentation of uneventful octreotide LAR use during three pregnancies in a woman with bronchial carcinoid-associated adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent Cushing's syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old Arabic woman presented to our emergency department with rapid onset of headache, flaring acne and hirsutism, facial puffiness, weight gain and paroxysmal myopathy, and paranoiac thoughts of rape and sexual intimidation. After undergoing surgical removal of a mass by left lower lung lobectomy, her residual lung disease medical therapy failed. Chronic octreotide LAR injections were initiated as indicated by a positive octreoscan.Follow-up revealed a long-lasting positive response to octreotide. Avidity of octreotide to somatostatin receptor sub-type 2 was later confirmed by a positive somatostatin receptor sub-type 2 in the resected tumor specimen. Against our instructions, the patient had three spontaneous pregnancies leading to delivery of three full-term healthy children while her octreotide LAR therapy continued. CONCLUSION: This case adds more data supporting the potential for the safe use of octreotide and the feasibility of octreotide LAR use during pregnancy, making compliance with the patient's preference not to withdraw octreotide therapy as soon as her pregnancy is confirmed a thoughtful option.","10.1186/1752-1947-5-386","","","Journal Article"

However, recent operative series suggest low morbidity and mortality for CS, whereas population-based surveys report elevated mortality rates. We investigated the mortality and morbidity of CS in New Zealand. DESIGN: A nationwide retrospective survey of patients with CS between 1960 and 2005 managed at the four main endocrinology services. PATIENTS: A total of 253 patients with CS were identified, excluding adrenal carcinoma and malignant ectopic CS. MEASUREMENTS; The primary outcome was the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), comparing the observed number of deaths with the expected number for the population matched for age, sex and duration of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the change in prevalence of co-morbidities at presentation and at final follow-up. RESULTS: The approximate prevalence and incidence of CS was 79/million and 1·8/million/y. The mean age at presentation was 39 year, and median duration of follow-up was 6·4 year (range 0-46). Overall, 89% achieved biochemical cure at last follow-up, with >90% achieving biochemical cure for CS from adrenal adenoma and pituitary causes. Thirty-six patients died during follow-up compared with 8·8 expected deaths (SMR 4·1, 95%CI 2·9-5·6). While hypertension, sexual dysfunction, myopathy and mild psychiatric illness were significantly reduced after treatment, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, moderate or major psychiatric illness, and osteoporosis were common at final follow-up.

Endocrinology and metabolism",2007,"Epidemiological evidence suggests alcoholic myopathy is more severe in females than males, but comparable animal studies are lacking that make elucidating the biochemical locus for this defect problematic. The present study determined whether skeletal muscle protein synthesis and markers of degradation exhibit a sexual dimorphic response to either chronic alcohol consumption or acute intoxication. Male and female rats were fed an alcohol-containing diet, pair-fed for 26 wk (chronic), or received an intraperitoneal injection of alcohol (acute). In males, chronic alcohol decreased gastrocnemius protein synthesis by 20%. This reduction was associated with a twofold increase in the inactive eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E.4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) complex and a 60% reduction in the active eIF4E.eIF4G complex. This redistribution of eIF4E was associated with decreased phosphorylation of both 4E-BP1 and eIF4G (50-55%). The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 was also reduced 60% in alcohol-consuming male rats. In contrast, neither rates of protein synthesis nor indexes of translation initiation in muscle were altered in alcohol-fed female rats despite blood alcohol levels comparable to males. Chronic alcohol ingestion did not alter atrogin-1 or muscle RING finger-1 mRNA content (biomarkers of muscle proteolysis) in males but increased their expression in females 50-100%. Acute alcohol intoxication produced a comparable decrease in muscle protein synthesis and translation initiation in both male and female rats. Our data demonstrate a sexual dimorphism for muscle protein synthesis, translation initiation, and proteolysis in response to chronic, but not acute, alcohol intoxication; however, they do not support evidence indicating females are more sensitive toward the development of alcoholic skeletal muscle myopathy.","10.1152/ajpendo.00603.2006","Acute Disease; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholic Intoxication; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Ethanol; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G; Female; Hormones; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Muscle Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Peptide Hydrolases; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Biosynthesis; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Ribosomal Protein S6; Sex Characteristics; Time Factors","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
9689743,"Protozoan infections (Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum and Sarcocystis spp.) in sheep and goats: recent advances.","Buxton D","Veterinary research",1998,"The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a serious cause of fetal mortality in sheep and goats. Oocysts, the parasite stage responsible for initiating infection, are produced following a primary infection in cats. A primary infection in pregnant sheep and goats can establish a placental and fetal infection which may result in fetal death and resorption, abortion or stillbirth. Diagnosis is aided by the clinical picture, the presence of characteristic small white necrotic foci in placental cotyledons, the possible presence of a mummified fetus and on fetal serology and histopathology. Development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for T. gondii may also provide a valuable diagnostic tool. Measures to control abortion include improved management of farm cats, fodder and water. Vaccination of sheep with the live vaccine is an effective preventive measure and the use of decoquinate in feed may be useful in some situations. Neospora caninum is related to T. gondii and while its asexual life cycle is similar to that of the latter it is currently not known whether it has a similar sexual life cycle in a definitive host. Neospora is an important cause of fetal loss in cattle and parallels that of T. gondii infection in sheep and goats. While it does not appear to cause frequent losses in these latter animals, experimental infection is readily induced in them and if initiated during pregnancy provides a very good model of the bovine infection. Furthermore clinical signs and pathological lesions in sheep and goats are similar to those induced in them by T. gondii, although there are subtle histopathological differences. These changes will aid possible diagnosis as will specific serological tests such as the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test and the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and the PCR. Sarcocystis, which exists as numerous species, undergoes a coccidian-like life cycle with each having a distinctive definitive (usually carnivore) host which excretes sporocysts into the environment. Clinical sarcocystiosis is much less commonly diagnosed than toxoplasmosis and neither is it normally associated with fetal infection or abortion in either sheep or goats. However, infection is extremely common throughout the world and follows ingestion of food or water contaminated with sporocysts. Clinical signs, when seen, include fever, anaemia, inappetance and weight loss or reduced weight gain. Central nervous signs (hind limb weakness, ataxia, paresis), acute myopathy and death may occur. Diagnosis is difficult as infection is so common and clinical signs absent, mild or non-specific. Serology may be useful in some situations and histopathology/immunohistochemistry is valuable for confirming the cause of death. Control relies on preventing contamination of pasture and water with faeces of dogs, foxes and cats or by controlling access of young susceptible stock to contaminated land. Relatively little is known of the immunity induced by infection with Sarcocystis spp. but research indicates that protective immunity does develop and that cell-mediated mechanisms are probably important. It is likely that sarcocystiosis is underdiagnosed as a problem and that better diagnostic methods are needed to show the true extent of the losses caused. Neosporosis on the other hand would appear not to be so common in sheep and goats. The value of experimental infections in these animals may be to provide a comparative model of the infection in cattle in the same way that our understanding of toxoplasmosis in sheep provides a superior model of human toxoplasmosis.",NA,"Animals; Coccidiosis; Goat Diseases; Goats; Neospora; Sarcocystosis; Sheep; Sheep Diseases; Toxoplasmosis, Animal","","Journal Article; Review"

All but six subjects were IDUs, and sexual transmission of HTLV-II and transfusion were involved in five and one individual, respectively. Eighty-four percent of the IDUs infected with HTLV-II were co-infected by HIV-I (93/107). Clinical manifestations potentially linked to HTLV-II were absent, although an IDU male co-infected by HIV-1 and HTLV-II developed a severe non-inflammatory proximal myopathy. In conclusion, HTLV-II infection is present in Spain, mainly among IDUs, with a growing incidence and a current overall prevalence of 2.0 percent.","10.1007/BF00499462","Adult; Aged; DNA, Viral; Female; HIV Infections; HIV-1; HTLV-II Antibodies; HTLV-II Infections; Human T-lymphotropic virus 2; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Registries; Risk Factors; Spain; Substance Abuse, Intravenous","","Journal Article"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specific characterization and quantification of hemodynamic abnormalities of the cavernous arterial inflow and corporeal veno-occlusive mechanism associated with failure to respond to intracavernous pharmacotherapy were performed retrospectively in 69 patients with nonendocrinological impotence. We investigated atherosclerotic vascular risk factors, duplex ultrasonography peak systolic and end diastolic velocities (10 micrograms. prostaglandin E1), and dynamic infusion cavernosometry and cavernosography parameters (60 mg. papaverine and 6 mg. phentolamine). RESULTS: The patients were stratified by severity of the various hemodynamic parameters encountered and mean dose required for response. Response subsequently was characterized as excellent (75% or greater rigid erections) in 36 patients, adequate (erections sufficient for intromission) in 17 and poor or absent in 16. Psychogenic, neurogenic and mild vasculogenic causes were noted in patients with an excellent response. The adequate responses included all 3 cases with mild to moderate vascular etiologies whereas patients with a poor or no response had only severe venogenic and combined arteriogenic and venogenic etiologies. Mean flow-to-maintain values plus or minus standard deviation of 9.7 +/- 3.7, 10.8 +/- 9.5 and 59.5 +/- 24.2 ml. per minute were demonstrated in the excellent, adequate and poor or no response groups, respectively. There was a good correlation between mean flow-to-maintain values and mean doses of our standard vasoactive solution (r2 = 0.88, p < 0.0001). Pharmaco-cavernosography demonstrated diffuse or pan-cavernous corporeal veno-occlusive dysfunction in the poor or no response group. CONCLUSIONS: Corporeal veno-occlusive dysfunction alone or combined with arterial disease is the specific hemodynamic abnormality causing nonresponse to intracavernous pharmacotherapy. Diffuse drainage, particularly involving the glans penis and corpus spongiosum, is greatly predictive of a poor or no response, reflecting the underlying cavernous smooth muscle myopathy and collagen degenerative alterations in these patients with end-organ failure.","10.1016/s0022-5347(01)65400-4","Adult; Aged; Alprostadil; Hemodynamics; Humans; Impotence, Vasculogenic; Male; Middle Aged; Penis; Phentolamine; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Failure; Vasodilator Agents; Veins","","Journal Article"

Serious morbidity from this disorder of iron absorption can occur in early as well as in middle and advanced age, iron overload having been reported in children with hereditary hemochromatosis as early as 2 years of age. Younger persons differ from older persons in that the risk for iron loading in females appears to be equal to the risk for males, in contrast to a preponderance of males among older patients. Also, younger patients frequently demonstrate cardiac and gonadal involvement, with cardiac failure commonly leading to death, whereas older patients are more likely to have liver involvement and diabetes mellitus, with liver failure and hepatoma commonly leading to death. Because early diagnosis and treatment can prevent the toxicities of iron overload, appropriate screening can be lifesaving. Transferrin saturation is the most reliable screening test. Liver biopsy with objective measurement of hepatic iron stores is the most important diagnostic criterion at present, although reliable noninvasive methods for quantitating body iron are being developed. Young individuals who should be screened for iron overload include patients with cardiac myopathies, hypogonadism, amenorrhea, loss of libido, diabetes mellitus, other endocrine disorders, cirrhosis of the liver, and arthritis, as well as the siblings, parents, and children of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or iron loading of unknown cause.","10.1097/00043426-198821000-00006","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Gene Frequency; Hemochromatosis; Humans; Iron; Neoplasms","","Journal Article; Review"

METHODS: We selected 11 patients with sALS (7 men), 14 with fALS8 (8 men) and 26 controls (15 men). All groups were gender and age-matched. For each subject, Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease for Autonomic Symptoms (SCOPA-AUT) was applied and data from heart rate variability, Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART) and skin sympathetic response (SSR) were collected. These data were compared across groups using nonparametric tests. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: SCOPA-AUT revealed predominant clinical complaints in thermoregulatory, pupillomotor and sexual domains in fALS8 relative to sALS as well as controls. Neurophysiological tests demonstrated significant differences in Valsalva ratio, Expiratory:Inspiratory index and RR minimum values in both ALS groups relative to controls. Sudomotor dysfunction was also observed in sALS and fALS8 groups, as shown by reduced medial forearm and foot QSART volumes and absence of SSR in lower limbs. CONCLUSIONS: Dysautonomia - cardiac and sudomotor - is part of the phenotype in sALS and fALS8. The profile of autonomic symptoms, however, is different in each group.

We aimed to determine the dietary intake of vitamin B6, folate, and vitamin B12 and ED in the United States population. METHODS: We extracted data from the 2001-2004 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Dietary intakes of B vitamins were collected based on one 24-hour dietary recall. The association between dietary intake of vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12 and ED was examined using multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 3,875 participants were included for analysis, with 1,201 reporting ED and 2,894 not experiencing ED. The multivariable odds ratios (ORs) for the highest vs. lowest quartiles of vitamin B6 was 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-0.99; P for trend =0.03] for the prevalence of ED.

Nonetheless, a considerable number of psychiatric hospital outpatient departments as well as practicing physicians continue to prescribe it. These professionals have formed the ""Network for Alcohol Aversive Pharmacotherapy"" (NAP) to maintain a high quality of this treatment approach. OBJECTIVE: To describe the current use of disulfiram with respect to patient numbers and characteristics, side effects, and use of concomitant multimodal treatment forms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 2019 the NAP has conducted an annual retrospective survey among its members regarding the aforementioned parameters. RESULTS: From 2019 to 2023 a total of 1579 treatment cases were described by 33 centers, 152 patients reported a total of 241 drinking events, 26 of them resulting in hospitalization but none causing complications or permanent harm. The most frequent side effects, in descending order, were unpleasant body odor (2.5%), fatigue, male sexual dysfunction, mildly elevated liver enzymes, allergic skin reactions and polyneuropathy (0.8%). More than one quarter of the patients suffered from comorbid depression, and approximately 5% from ADHD, borderline or other personality disorders, trauma-related disorders and anxiety disorders, respectively. Of the patients 33% were treated with antidepressants and 12% with sedating antipsychotics. Various forms of concomitant group therapy were offered to 66% of the patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment with disulfiram is legally possible, generally well-tolerated and safe. It is offered in most treatment centers as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that includes multimodal treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Seit mehr als 10 Jahren ist Disulfiram in Deutschland nicht mehr zugelassen. Dennoch wird es seitens einer Reihe von Ambulanzen psychiatrischer Fachkliniken sowie niedergelassener Ärzte weiter off-label eingesetzt. Diese haben sich 2018 zum „Netzwerk alkoholaversive Pharmakotherapie“ (NAP) zusammengeschlossen, um die Qualität dieser Behandlungsform aufrechtzuhalten. ZIEL DER ARBEIT: Beschreibung des gegenwärtigen Behandlungsumfangs, der Patientencharakteristika, der Nebenwirkungen und der begleitenden Therapieangebote der Behandlung mit Disulfiram.

METHODS: In December 2021, an electronic REDCap survey was circulated to 6,918 BC survivors (stage 0-4) enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Breast Disease Registry. The questionnaire asked about satisfaction with BC care delivery, and education and support receive(d) regarding BC linked concerns. Patients also ranked Quality Improvement (QI) proposals. RESULTS: The survey received 2,437 responses. 18% had Ductal Carcinoma in Situ, 81% had early breast cancer (EBC), i.e. stage 1-3, and 2% had metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Mean age was 64 (SD 11.8), and mean time since diagnosis was 93 months (SD 70.2). 69.3% of patients received all care at Mayo Clinic. The overall experience of care was good (> 90%). The main severe symptoms recalled in year 1 were alopecia, eyebrow/eyelash thinning, hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, and cognitive issues. The main concerns recalled were fear of BC recurrence/spread; loved ones coping; fear of dying, and emotional health. Patients were most dissatisfied with information regarding sexual dysfunction, eyebrow/eyelash thinning, peripheral neuropathy, and on side effects of immunotherapy/targeted therapies. Top ranking QI projects were: i) Lifetime access to concise educational resources; ii) Holistic support programs for MBC and iii) Wellness Programs for EBC and MBC. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early and advanced BC desire psychological support, concise educational resources, and holistic care.

Exercise therapy is often used to mitigate the adverse effects of treatment. But how good is the evidence base, and what has changed in recent years? In this narrative review, we present the current data and what it implies for the care of adults with cancer. METHODS: This review is based on data from meta-analyses and systematic reviews concerning 16 relevant clinical endpoints (outcomes) of exercise therapy for cancer patients. RESULTS: The literature evaluated for this paper reveals that targeted exercise therapy is feasible and safe under appropriate supervision. It is highly effective for improving eight endpoints (anxiety, depression, fatigue, quality of life, physical function, secondary lymphedema after breast cancer, urinary incontinence, post-mastectomy pain syndrome in breast cancer) and may also have a beneficial effect on sleep quality, cardiotoxicity, and cognitive function. Less conclusive studies are currently available with respect to chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy, nausea/vomiting, and bone health. There is currently insufficient data to suggest any benefit with respect to sexual function and risk factors for falling. CONCLUSION: The data shows that exercise therapy for cancer patients is safe and has manifold effects on selected clinically relevant parameters. Further studies should be performed regarding the possible utility of exercise therapy against treatment-related side effects for which the evidence is currently insufficient. On the basis of the currently available and already existing recommendations, quality-assured exercise therapy can be recommended to cancer patients suffering from a wide range of neoplastic conditions.","10.3238/arztebl.m2024.0038","Humans; Exercise Therapy; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; Medical Oncology","","Journal Article; Review"

On the symptom scale, insomnia (46/100), fatigue (41/100), dyspnea (32/100), pain (26/100), and financial difficulties (25/100) were scored the worst. According to EORTC-QLQ-CX24, peripheral neuropathy (36/100) and lymphedema (32/100) occurred most frequently. Impaired sexual/vaginal functioning (32/100) and body image (22/100) were also frequently recorded. CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced cervical cancer, a combination of RCT and BT remains an excellent treatment option. In terms of patient-reported long-term quality of life, specific support is needed to alleviate symptoms including lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, and impaired sexual activity.","10.1007/s00066-023-02196-1","Humans; Female; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Brachytherapy; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Chemoradiotherapy; Aged; Adult; Quality of Life; Neoplasm Staging; Treatment Outcome; Aged, 80 and over; Prospective Studies","External radiation and interstitial brachytherapy; Locally advanced cervical cancer; Quality of life; Questionnaires; Radiochemotherapy","Journal Article"

However, there was insufficient evidence to generate exercise prescriptions for 10 health outcomes of cancer treatment. We sought to update the state of evidence. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of these 10 understudied health outcomes (bone health, sleep, cardiovascular function, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), cognitive function, falls and balance, nausea, pain, sexual function, and treatment tolerance) and provided an update of evidence. RESULTS: While the evidence base for each outcome has increased, there remains insufficient evidence to generate exercise prescriptions. Common limitations observed across outcomes included: variability in type and quality of outcome measurement tools, variability in definitions of the health outcomes, a lack of phase III trials, and a majority of trials investigating breast or prostate cancer survivors only. CONCLUSION: We identified progress in the field of exercise oncology for several understudied cancer- and treatment-related health outcomes. However, we were not able to generate exercise prescriptions due to continued insufficient evidence base. More work is needed to prescribe exercise as medicine for these understudied health outcomes, and our review highlights several strategies to aid in research acceleration within these areas of exercise oncology.","10.1002/cam4.6753","Male; Humans; Cancer Survivors; Exercise; Neoplasms; Exercise Therapy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome; Quality of Life","bone; cardiovascular; chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy; cognition; falls; nausea; neoplasm; pain; sexual function; sleep; treatment tolerance","Systematic Review; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

The aim of this study was to identify existing PA guidelines for cancer survivors, describe the recommendations, and assess their methodology quality. METHODS: A rapid review of the literature was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE, supplemented by a search of the grey literature. The methodological quality of the guidelines was assessed using the AGREE II checklist. A descriptive synthesis of the recommendations from guidelines judged to be of good quality has been performed. RESULTS: A total of nine guidelines published between 2006 and 2019 were included. Of nine guidelines, five achieved a high enough AGREE II score and were judged to be of good quality for use in clinical practice. We found that the recommendations from the five guidelines converged on the prescription of supervised PA (aerobic and resistance exercise) of at least 75 min per week of high intensity or 150 min per week of moderate intensity, spread over two to five sessions per week, equating to a PA dose between 8.70 and 17.5 MET.h/week. The recommendations were applicable to address the most common side effects of cancer and its treatment, namely fatigue, lymphedema, anxiety, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life (QoL), survival, and physical function. However, no guideline recommends PA to improve other cancer-related outcomes, such as cognitive impairment, falls, sexual function, and peripheral neuropathy frequently experienced by cancer survivors. No guideline also referred to work outcomes (i.e., work ability, return to work, etc.). CONCLUSION: Most PA guidelines for cancer survivors are of good quality. However, specific PA guidelines are needed for a given cancer site (e.g., location, stage), at a particular phase of the cancer trajectory, and for specific outcomes including return to work (RTW) in order to tailor PA to each cancer survivor.","10.1007/s00520-023-08123-5","Humans; Quality of Life; Neoplasms; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Exercise","Cancer; Guidelines; Physical activity; Recommendations","Journal Article; Review"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 180 participants (120 T2DM and 60 controls) in the cross-sectional study. First, we compared the serum ISM1 concentration in diabetic patients and non-diabetic controls. Secondly, according to DSPN, patients were divided into DSPN and non-DSPN groups. Last, patients were categorized as lean T2DM (15 males, 15 females), overweight T2DM (35 males, 19 females), and obese T2DM groups (23 males, 13 females) according to gender and body mass index (BMI). All participants were collected with clinical characteristics and biochemical profiles. Serum ISM1 was detected in all subjects by ELISA. RESULTS: Higher serum ISM1 [7.78 ng/mL (IQR: 6.33-9.06) vs 5.22 (3.86-6.04), P <0.001] was observed in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic controls. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that serum ISM1 was a risk factor for type 2 diabetes after adjustment (OR=4.218, 95% CI: 1.843-9.653, P=0.001). Compared to the non-DSPN group, serum ISM1 level was not changed significantly in patients who suffered from DSPN. Diabetic females with obesity had lower level of serum ISM1 (7.10±1.29 ng/mL) when compared to the lean T2DM (8.42±1.36 ng/mL, P <0.05) and the overweight T2DM (8.33±1.27 ng/mL, P <0.05). However, serum ISM1 was not changed significantly in male groups or all patients together. CONCLUSION: Serum ISM1 was a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and it was associated with diabetic adults with obesity while there was sexual dimorphism. However, serum ISM1 levels were not correlated with DSPN.","10.2147/DMSO.S411127","","diabetic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy; inflammation; isthmin-1; obesity; type 2 diabetes","Journal Article"
36584063,"Modeling the spread of the Zika virus by sexual and mosquito transmission.","Agudelo S; Ventresca M","PloS one",2022,"Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that is transmitted predominantly by the Aedes species of mosquito, but also through sexual contact, blood transfusions, and congenitally from mother to child. Although approximately 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic and typical symptoms are mild, multiple studies have demonstrated a causal link between ZIKV and severe diseases such as Microcephaly and Guillain Barré Syndrome. Two goals of this study are to improve ZIKV models by considering the spread dynamics of ZIKV as both a vector-borne and sexually transmitted disease, and also to approximate the degree of under-reporting. In order to accomplish these objectives, we propose a compartmental model that allows for the analysis of spread dynamics as both a vector-borne and sexually transmitted disease, and fit it to the ZIKV incidence reported to the National System of Public Health Surveillance in 27 municipalities of Colombia between January 1 2015 and December 31 2017. We demonstrate that our model can represent the infection patterns over this time period with high confidence. In addition, we argue that the degree of under-reporting is also well estimated. Using the model we assess potential viability of public health scenarios for mitigating disease spread and find that targeting the sexual pathway alone has negligible impact on overall spread, but if the proportion of risky sexual behavior increases then it may become important. Targeting mosquitoes remains the best approach of those considered. These results may be useful for public health organizations and governments to construct and implement suitable health policies and reduce the impact of the Zika outbreaks.","10.1371/journal.pone.0270127","Animals; Female; Humans; Aedes; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Mosquito Vectors; Sexual Behavior; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The control of these molecular programs exhibits sexually dimorphic characteristics that remain not sufficiently characterized. In the present study, we recorded genome-wide and sex-dependent early-phase transcriptional changes in regenerating (proximal) sciatic nerve 24 h after axotomy. Male nerves exhibited more extensive transcriptional changes with male-dominant upregulation of cytoskeletal binding and structural protein genes. Regulation of mRNAs encoding ion and ionotropic neurotransmitter channels displayed prominent sexual dimorphism consistent with sex-specific mRNA axonal transport in an early-phase regenerative response. Protein kinases and axonal transport genes showed sexually dimorphic regulation. Genes encoding components of synaptic vesicles were at high baseline expression in females and showed post-injury induction selectively in males. Predictive bioinformatic analyses established patterns of sexually dimorphic regulation of neurotrophic and immune genes, including activation of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor Gfra1 receptor and immune checkpoint cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) potentially linked to X-chromosome encoded tissue inhibitor of matrix metallo proteinases 1 (Timp1). Regulatory networks involving Olig1, Pou3f3/Oct6, Myrf, and Myt1l transcription factors were linked to sex-dependent reprogramming in regenerating nerves. Differential expression patterns of non-coding RNAs motivate a model of sexually dimorphic nerve regenerative responses to injury determined by epigenetic factors. Combined with our findings in the corresponding dorsal root ganglia (DRG), unique early-phase sex-specific molecular triggers could enrich the mechanistic understanding of peripheral neuropathies.","10.3389/fnmol.2022.958568","","RNA-seq; axotomy; nerve regeneration; peripheral nerve; sexual dimorphism","Journal Article"
35899123,"The Outcomes of Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter 2 Inhibitors (SGLT2I) on Diabetes-Associated Neuropathy: A Systematic Review and meta-Analysis.","Kandeel M","Frontiers in pharmacology",2022,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. DM patients with diabetic neuropathy (DN) usually present with distal pain, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, postural hypotension, or erectile dysfunction. They also may present with other nerve pathologies such as inflammatory neuropathies and carpal tunnel syndrome. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the benefits of using sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is) to manage DN. An extensive systematic literature review was conducted to include all articles published up to 24 February 2022. All clinical studies included patients with DM and reported the outcomes of SGLT2I on diabetes-associated neuropathy. Six studies were identified for meta-analysis, including a total of 5312 diabetic patients. The average age of the included patients ranged from 41 to 74 years and 34-73 years in the SGLT2I treatment and control groups, respectively. SGLT2I moderately improved the manifestations of diabetic peripheral neuropathy events and nerve conduction velocity. Furthermore, the SGLT2I treatment group had a statistically significant higher mean heart-to-mediastinum ratio (MD 0.41; 95% 0.17, 0.64; p = 0.0006). However, the mean heart rates (MD -4.51; 95% -10.05, 1.04; p = 0.11) and wash out rates (MD 2.13; 95% -8.48, 12.75; p = 0.69) were not significantly different between the two groups. SGLT2Is could therefore be considered neuroprotective in patients with DN, possibly by considerably increasing the sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity, improving the clinical manifestations of DPN, and reducing sympathetic nervous system activity.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Conduct an analytical review of the available literature data on the use of ESWT in oncology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review was conducted, including data from electronic databases: Scopus, Web of Science, MedLine, World Health Organization, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ScienceDirect, US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, PubMed, Google Scholar, elibrary, CyberLeninka, disserCat. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study of ESWT in oncology is carried out in two directions: 1) impact on the tumor with the aim of its disintegration, inhibition of growth, enhancement of the action of radiation and/or chemotherapy; 2) rehabilitation of cancer patients. Shock waves in vitro and in vivo significantly reduce the viability and activate apoptosis of cell lines of osteosarcoma, cancer of the stomach, colon, rectum, bladder, breast, urothelial cancer of the upper urinary tract, adenocarcinoma of the cervix, Burkitt's lymphoma, sarcoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer glands, glioblastoma multiforme. Shock waves also sensitize tumor cells for adjuvant chemotherapy and increase its antitumor activity. The lack of a stimulating effect on a number of malignant tumors in this physical factor makes it possible to conduct ESWT studies in the rehabilitation of cancer patients. The data obtained by a number of authors indicate the clinical efficacy of ESWT in the rehabilitation of patients with erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy, with postmastectomy lymphedema of the upper limb, with myofascial pain syndrome after cervical lymph node dissection due to malignant neoplasms of the head and neck, with peripheral polyneuropathy induced by cytostatics. However, in order to develop indications and contraindications for the appointment of ESWT in the rehabilitation of cancer patients, it is not enough just to evaluate its clinical effectiveness; currently absent scientific studies with long-term follow-up of patients who received this method of physiotherapy are needed.

РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ И ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: Исследование ЭУВТ в онкологии проводится в двух направлениях: 1) воздействие на опухоль с целью ее распада, торможения роста, усиления действия лучевой и/или химиотерапии; 2) реабилитация онкологических больных. Ударные волны in vitro и in vivo значительно снижают жизнеспособность и активируют апоптоз клеточных линий остеосаркомы, рака желудка, толстой кишки, прямой кишки, мочевого пузыря, молочной железы, уротелиального рака верхних мочевыводящих путей, аденокарциномы шейки матки, лимфомы Беркитта, саркомы, анапластического рака щитовидной железы, мультиформной глиобластомы. Также ударные волны сенсибилизируют опухолевые клетки для адъювантной химиотерапии, увеличивают ее противоопухолевую активность. Отсутствие у данного физического фактора стимулирующего действия на ряд злокачественных опухолей дает возможность проведения исследований ЭУВТ в реабилитации онкологических больных.

The disease and its treatment significantly affect survivors' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We determined the overall quality of life (QoL) and identified its predictors among cervical cancer survivors after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on 153 disease-free cervical cancer survivors who completed curative treatment between January 2004 and December 2018 at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana. We used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core-30 item (EORTC QLQ-C30) and cervical cancer module (EORTC QLQ-CX24) to assess the survivors' overall QoL. QoL domain scores were dichotomised as affected or unaffected by disease and its treatment. Significant differences between the affected and unaffected groups within each QoL domain were determined using the student T-test. We used Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests to examine the difference in QoL domains between treatment types, with significance based on Bonferroni corrections. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of overall QoL. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three (153) women having a mean age of 58.3 (SD 11.4) years were studied. The overall QoL score was 79.6 (SD 16.0), and 74.5% of survivors reported good QoL score within the median follow up time of 41.8 months (interquartile range [IQR], 25.5-71.1 months) after cervical cancer diagnosis. Although the majority (66.0-84.3%) of the QoL functioning scale were unaffected, about a fifth (22.2%) to a third (34.5%) of the subjects had perceptual impairment in cognitive and role functioning. Financial difficulties, peripheral neuropathy and pain were most common symptoms reported as affected. A third of the survivors were worried that sex would be painful, and 36.6% indicated that their sexual activity as affected. The overall QoL scores for survivors who had surgery, chemoradiation and radiation-alone were 86.1 (SD 9.7), 76.9 (SD 17.7), and 80.7 (SD 14.7), respectively (p = 0.025). The predictors of survivor's overall QoL were loss of appetite [Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR) = 9.34, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 2.13-35.8, p = 0.001], pain (AOR = 3.53, 95% CI = 1.25-9.31, p = 0.017) and body image (AOR = 5.89, 95% CI = 1.80-19.27, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: About 75% of the survivors had a good overall quality of life. Primary surgical treatment affords the best prospects for quality of life with the least symptom complaints and financial burden. Loss of appetite, pain or diminution in body image perception predicted the overall quality of life of cervical cancer survivors after treatment.","10.1371/journal.pone.0268831","Cancer Survivors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Ghana; Humans; Middle Aged; Pain; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survivors; Tertiary Care Centers; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","","Journal Article"

Throughout this time, Eastern European countries have been left aside from the decision-making groups on this matter, hence the absence of similar studies in this geographical area. In these countries, the quality of life (QoL) of patients with cervical cancer might be considered a “caprice”, and the discomforts they encounter following pelvic exenteration for cervical cancer are often perceived as a “normal phenomenon”. Methods: This study examined forty-seven patients submitted to pelvic exenteration followed up for nine years after the surgical intervention. The first objective of this study is to identify the prognostic factors that influence the overall survival (OS) of patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for FIGO stage IVA, recurrent or persistent cervical cancer after previous conclusive treatments. The second objective is to assess the QoL of the surviving patients using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CX24 standardized questionnaires. Results: The mean age of the participants was 54 years (range 36−67). At the time of the study, there were 25 living patients (53.2%), the 3-year OS was 61%, and the 5-year OS was 48.7%. Cox regression analysis recognized parameter invasion, pelvic lymph node metastases, positive resection margins, early postoperative complications, and infralevatorian pelvic exenteration as negative prognostic factors influencing the OS (p < 0.05). Of the 25 survivors, 18 patients answered the QoL questionnaires. The cost of favorable survival has been translated into poor overall QoL, unsatisfactory functional, social, and symptom scores, a high prevalence of cervical cancer-specific symptoms such as lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, severe menopausal symptoms, distorted body image, and lack of sexual desire. The lower scores are comparable to the only three studies available in the literature that assessed the QoL of patients undergoing pelvic exenteration precisely for cervical cancer. Conclusions: Despite its retrospective nature and some limitations, this paper, similar to other studies, shows a decent OS but with a marked adverse impact on QoL, suggesting the importance of adequate psycho-emotional and financial support for these patients following pelvic exenteration. This study also contributes to the current knowledge regarding advanced cervical cancer treatment, depicting survival, prognostic factors, and QoL of patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for cervical cancer in a reference center in Eastern Europe. Our study can provide a comparison for future prospective randomized trials needed to confirm these results.","10.3390/cancers14092346","","QLQ-C30; QLQ-CX24; cervical cancer; pelvic exenteration; quality of life; survival","Journal Article"

GPR171 is a promising therapeutic target that is widely expressed through the brain, including within the descending pain modulatory regions. Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of the GPR171 agonist, MS15203, in its ability to alleviate chronic pain in male and female mice using a once-daily systemic dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.) of MS15203 over the course of 5 days. We found that in our models of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), MS15203 did not alleviate thermal hypersensitivity and allodynia, respectively, in female mice. On the other hand, MS15203 treatment decreased the duration of thermal hypersensitivity in CFA-treated male mice following 3 days of once-daily administration. MS15203 treatment also produced an improvement in allodynia in male mice, but not female mice, in neuropathic pain after 5 days of treatment. Gene expression of GPR171 and that of its endogenous ligand BigLEN, encoded by the gene PCSK1N, were unaltered within the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in both male and female mice following inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, following neuropathic pain in male mice, the protein levels of GPR171 were decreased in the PAG. Treatment with MS15203 then rescued the protein levels of GPR171 in the PAG of these mice. Taken together, our results identify GPR171 as a GPCR that displays sexual dimorphism in alleviation of chronic pain. Further, our results suggest that GPR171 and MS15203 have demonstrable therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic pain.","10.3389/fpain.2021.695396","","G-protein coupled receptor; inflammation; neuropathy; orphan receptor; sex difference","Journal Article"

AIM: To investigate the effect of GJG on L-OHP-induced ED in rats. METHODS: Twelve-week-old male Wister/ST rats were categorized into the following groups: Sham, Sham+GJG, L-OHP, and L-OHP+GJG (each n = 10). The L-OHP and L-OHP+GJG groups were injected intravenously with L-OHP (4 mg/kg) for 2 consecutive days in the first week. Statistical significance was determined using Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. OUTCOMES: At the end of the study period, erectile function was evaluated by measuring intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) after cavernous nerve stimulation. Western blot analysis was used to assess the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the expression of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-1. RESULTS: The ICP/MAP ratio of L-OHP rats (0.34 ± 0.06) was significantly lower than that of Sham rats (0.67 ± 0.03, P < .01), however, the ICP/MAP ratio of L-OHP+GJG rats (0.55 ± 0.01) was significantly higher than that of L-OHP rats (P < .01). There were no significant differences in the nNOS and eNOS protein expression between both groups (P > .05). GJG administration significantly decreased PDE-5 and NADPH oxidase-1 messenger RNA expressions in the L-OHP+GJG group. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: This animal model study suggests that GJG might be effective for erectile function in cancer survivors. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Our study identified that GJG had no notable side effects in the treated group. Further investigation of the cavernous nerve would also help elucidate the mechanism of GJG effect, which is a limitation of this study.

In Eastern European developing countries, the health care system often cannot afford the uppermost standardized treatment for these patients. In the absence of a comparable study in our country, the authors' aim for this retrospective cross-sectional observational study was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and the QoL o cervical cancer survivors; (2) Methods: 430 patients were analyzed. The first objective is to evaluate the OS rates of patients with cervical cancer stages IA2 to IIB undergoing radical hysterectomy (RH) +/- neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiotherapy +/- chemoradiotherapy treatment combinations. The second objective is to assess their QoL, using two standardized questionnaires issued by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), namely QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CX24. (3) Results: The mean age of the participants was 51 years (22-76) and the average follow-up time was 65 months (2-128). At the time of the analysis, 308 out of 430 patients were alive, with a mean five-year OS of 72.4%. The multivariate Cox regression analysis identified stage IIB, parametrial invasion, and the lymph node metastases as independent prognostic risk factors negatively impacting the OS. Of the 308 patients still alive at the time of the analysis, 208 (68%) answered the QoL questionnaires. The QLQ-C30 shows a good long-term Global QoL of 64.6 (median), good functioning scores, and a decent symptom scale value. However, the EORTC QLQ-CX24 showed high values of cervical cancer-specific symptoms, namely: lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, severe menopausal symptoms, and distorted body-image perception. The results also indicate a significant decline in the quality of sexual life with a low sexual enjoyment and decreased level of sexual activities. (4) Conclusion: Despite a good OS, in this setting of patients, cervical cancer survivors have a modest QoL and sexual function. Our study may provide a comparison for future randomized, controlled trials in Eastern European countries needing to confirm these results.","10.3390/cancers14020317","","QLQ-C30; QLQ-CX24; disease-free survivors; long-term cervical cancer survival; prognostic factors; quality of life; sexual functioning","Journal Article"

As little is known about the aetiology and clinical context of this complaint, this study investigated the relationship between vaginal dryness and other clinical parameters associated with pSS. METHODS: Female participants of the REgistry of Sjögren syndrome at UMCG - LongiTudinal (RESULT) cohort who fulfilled ACR-EULAR and/or AECG classification criteria for pSS were included, using baseline data for analyses. Patient-reported vaginal dryness (range 0-10) was correlated with demographic characteristics, systemic disease activity (i.e., ESSDAI), Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Damage Index, salivary and lacrimal gland function, patient-reported outcomes (ESSPRI, MFI), serology and quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D). Significantly associated parameters (p<0.05) were corrected for potential confounders. RESULTS: This cross-sectional study included 199 women with pSS; mean age was 52±14 years, 53% were postmenopausal, and median vaginal dryness score was 5 (IQR 2-7). Vaginal dryness was significantly associated with older age, postmenopausal status, peripheral neuropathy, oral and ocular dryness, ESSPRI and SF-36 mental and general health. After correction for age, menopausal status and medication use, peripheral neuropathy (B=1.632), oral dryness (B=0.302), and ocular dryness (B=0.230) were independently associated with vaginal dryness. CONCLUSIONS: The independent association of vaginal dryness with oral and ocular dryness might imply that the aetiology of these symptoms is partly shared. Of all extraglandular features, only peripheral neuropathy was independently associated with vaginal dryness, suggesting that peripheral neuropathy plays a significant role in the pathology of vaginal dryness in pSS.","10.55563/clinexprheumatol/hzveng","Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Sjogren's Syndrome","","Journal Article"
34417713,"Prevalence vs impact: a mixed methods study of survivorship issues in colorectal cancer.","Drury A; Payne S; Brady AM","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2022,"PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the prevalence of CRC survivorship issues and their impact on survivors' quality of life (QoL). METHODS: This study utilised a mixed methods sequential explanatory design. Adult CRC survivors between 6- and 60-months post-diagnosis (n = 304) were purposively recruited from three hospitals and twenty-one cancer support centres in Ireland. QoL was evaluated using the EuroQol and FACT-C questionnaires and results compared to population norms. 22 survey participants took part in semi-structured interviews exploring the impact of survivorship issues on their daily lives. RESULTS: While CRC survivors reported QoL outcomes comparable to or better than normative populations, 54% were dissatisfied with their QoL. The most common survivorship issues reported included negative body image (74%), fatigue (68%), sexual dysfunction (66%) and sleep disturbance (59%). Thematic analysis of the qualitative data illustrated survivors' attempts to live with the impact of cancer and its treatment (loss, fear, impact) and striving to contextualise, reframe and understand the consequences of cancer and its treatment (control, vigilance, benefit). Within these themes, the cross-domain impact of less prevalent symptoms including bowel dysfunction (28-57%) and peripheral neuropathy (47%) were widely discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Although cancer survivors report positive QoL outcomes, many experience distressing physical, psychological and social effects. The findings suggest less common and difficult to manage symptoms are the greatest source of distress and unmet need. Support and information must be tailored to address survivors' individual needs and preferences for support, informed by holistic person-centred assessment.","10.1007/s11136-021-02975-2","Adult; Cancer Survivors; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Survivorship","Cancer survivorship; Colorectal cancer; Integration; Mixed methods; Patient reported outcomes","Journal Article"

The American Cancer Society's projections for colorectal cancer in 2020 are 147,950 new cases and 53,200 deaths. By 2024, there will be an estimated 1.71 million colorectal cancer survivors (17% of all cancer survivors) and many will experience long-term consequences. These problems may be the result of one or more treatment options: surgical resection, systemic chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Problems include issues with bowel, ostomy, bladder, sexual health, peripheral neuropathy, and mental health.

This systematic review aims to summarise patient-reported outcome (PRO) data concerning health-related quality of life, functional impacts and common side-effects of treatments for testicular cancer. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline OVID, CINAHL, PubMed, Embase and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Over Time In Oncology (PROMOTION) databases from inception to 25 March 2020, using ""testicular cancer"" and ""PRO"" search terms developed in conjunction with a medical librarian. Two authors screened abstracts and full-text articles for studies that reported primary PRO data related to the treatment of testicular cancer including at least 50 participants. We excluded psychosocial data as this was included in our companion review. Data were extracted by three reviewers, and quality was assessed by two reviewers using QUAL-SYST. Studies with a quality of score over 65% were included in our narrative synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 1831 records were identified via our database searches and 41 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 35 included participants who had chemotherapy. Twenty-eight different PRO measures were used across the 41 studies. Of the 41 studies, 29 had quality scores over 65% and were included in our narrative synthesis. We found that chemotherapy was generally associated with a higher side-effect burden than other treatments, and higher burden was associated with higher doses of chemotherapy. Hearing problems, peripheral neuropathy, and Raynaud's phenomena were particularly common side-effects. Problems with sexual functioning were associated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. DISCUSSION: While many studies found that between-treatment differences resolved within the first 12 months since diagnosis, there were many long-term and dose-dependent impacts associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy across PRO domains. Offering information about these aspects, and information about expected survival outcomes, will help inform, prepare, and empower patients to make decisions about treatment aligned with their preferences and personal situations.","10.2147/PROM.S242754","","cancer survivorship; patient-reported outcomes; quality of life; testicular cancer","Journal Article; Review"

METHODS: QoL was measured at baseline and at every end of two cycles, for the median of 8 cycles among 146 breast cancer women on AC and AC-T chemotherapy, using EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 instruments. The effect of QoL score, socio-demographic, and clinical variables at baseline were adjusted for the effect of chemotherapy's toxicities on QoL. RESULTS: Overall QoL, all functional scales (except cognitive functioning, body image, future perspectives, and sexual functioning) and symptom scales (except dyspnea, insomnia, pain score, arm, and breast symptoms) of EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 deteriorated significantly both clinically and statistically, in particular, during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. After the end of cycle 2 or 4, except for cognitive, social functioning, and financial difficulties of the patients, almost all other QoL dimensions were improved towards pretreatment score by the end of cycle 8. In addition to age, educational status, and tumor stage, the Global Health Status (-10.55≤B≤-7.71, P≤0.013), and the functional scales (-25.320≤B≤-6.351, P≤0.033) of EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 were significantly affected at least by one of the AC and AC-T chemotherapy's toxicity such as grade≥2 fatigue, dysgeusia, constipation, dry mouth, vomiting, oral mucositis, skin hyperpigmentation and/or peripheral neuropathy than their lower grade. Grade≥2 fatigue, dysgeusia, oral mucositis, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, anemia arthralgia/myalgia, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, and/or skin hyperpigmentation were positively predicted for the deterioration of symptoms scale of EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 (4.819≤B≤26.451, P≤0.043). CONCLUSION: Quality of life among Ethiopian breast cancer patients on AC and AC-T regimens significantly deteriorated particularly during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. In addition to the age, tumor stage and educational status of the patients, grade≥2 fatigue, dysgeusia, constipation, oral mucositis, dry mouth, peripheral neuropathy, and skin hyperpigmentation due to AC and AC-T chemotherapy were frequently associated with deterioration of different scales/items QoL. Hence, devising different strategies to improve the deteriorated QoL due to chemotherapy's toxicities particularly during the first two cycles has paramount importance.","10.2147/BCTT.S289014","","Ethiopia; breast cancer; chemotherapy; deterioration; quality of life; toxicity","Journal Article"

This prospective, observational study compared patient- and clinician-reported symptomatic AEs in phase I patients. METHODS: Phase I study-eligible patients at Princess Margaret were surveyed with the PRO-CTCAE full-item library (78 symptomatic AEs) at baseline (BL), mid-cycle 1, and mid-cycle 2 (C2). Patient and trial characteristics, best response, and survival data were collected. Presence or absence of patient- (PRO-CTCAE) or clinician-reported symptomatic AEs were compared (kappa) at defined timepoints and overall (BL+ mid-cycle 1 + C2). RESULTS: Of 292 patients approached from May 2017 to January 2019, a total of 265 (90.8%) were consented, with 243 (91.7%) evaluable and 552 PRO-CTCAE surveys (completion rate = 98.7%) included in analyses. Evaluation of overall patient-reported symptomatic AEs identified 50 PRO-CTCAE and 11 CTCAE items with 10% or greater reporting frequency. Nineteen CTCAE items were reported as 1% or less despite matched PRO-CTCAE items reporting as 10% or greater. Underreported categories included sexual health, bodily emissions, and cognition. Clinician- relative to patient-reporting frequency (ratio) demonstrated 9 symptomatic AEs with a 50-fold or more lower clinician reporting rate. Overall patient-clinician agreement for individual symptomatic AEs ranged from poor (κ = 0.00-0.19) to moderate (κ = 0.40-0.59), with discordance driven by lack of clinician reporting. Dyspnea (κ = 0.54) and peripheral neuropathy (κ = 0.63) at BL and limb edema (κ = 0.55) at C2 demonstrated the highest patient-clinician agreement.

Much of our knowledge on health problems and infectious encountered by international travellers has evolved as a result of GeoSentinel surveillance, providing geographic and temporal trends in morbidity among travellers while contributing to improved pre-travel advice. We set out to synthesize epidemiological information, clinical manifestations and time trends for dengue, chikungunya and Zika in travellers as captured by GeoSentinel. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed on international travellers who presented with dengue, chikungunya or Zika virus infections to GeoSentinel sites around the world from 1995 until 2020. RESULTS: Of 107 GeoSentinel publications, 42 articles were related to dengue, chikungunya and/or Zika. The final analyses and synthesis of and results presented here are based on the findings from 27 original articles covering the three arboviral diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue is the most frequent arboviral disease encountered in travellers presenting to GeoSentinel sites, with increasing trends over the past two decades. In Southeast Asia, annual proportionate morbidity increased from 50 dengue cases per 1000 ill returned travellers in non-epidemic years to an average of 159 cases per 1000 travellers during epidemic years. The highest number of travellers with chikungunya virus infections was reported during the chikungunya outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean in the years 2013-16. Zika was first reported by GeoSentinel already in 2012, but notifications peaked in the years 2016-17 reflecting the public health emergency in the Americas at the time.","10.1093/jtm/taaa222","Americas; Asia, Southeastern; Caribbean Region; Chikungunya Fever; Dengue; Humans; Population Surveillance; Travel-Related Illness; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Guillain–Barré syndrome; Travel; autochthonous transmission; congenital Zika syndrome; importation; sexual transmission; systematic review","Journal Article; Systematic Review"

The prevalence increases with age. Basic and clinical research is identifying the neurovascular and humoral control of the mechanisms. The initial evaluation should differentiate erectile dysfunction from premature ejaculation and loss of libido. Myocardial insufficiency, hypogonadism and peripheral neuropathy should be looked for. Initial laboratory investigations should be restricted to identifying previously undetected medical illness that may directly contribute to erectile dysfunction. Discussing the available options with the couple is an important aspect. If erectile dysfunction is secondary to other treatable disorders these should be treated simultaneously. When other diseases that require intervention are ruled out and if there are no contraindications, therapy may be initiated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In selected cases, psychosexual therapy may be beneficial. If phosphodiesterase inhibitors are contraindicated, vacuum constriction devices may be tried. Further options include intracavernosal injection, intraurethral instillation, penile revascularization and prosthesis. The availability of effective and well-tolerated oral medications has dramatically changed the clinical approach to erectile dysfunction. Pharmacotherapy is the preferred cost-effective first-line therapy in the vast majority of patients. A stepped-care approach is followed in the primary care and family practice settings. Appropriate urological, endocrine and psychiatric referrals, and shared decision-making with the couple will enable effective treatment of men with erectile dysfunction.",NA,"Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; India; Male; Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors; Prevalence; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article; Review"

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess of the prevalence and risk factors associated with FSD in Romanian women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (CAT). METHODS: The study sample included 104 Romanian women with both T1DM and CAT, and 101 Romanian matched controls with only T1DM. The presence of FSD was established using two validated tests: The Female Sexual Function Index and the Female Sexual Distress Scale-revised. The presence of depression was assessed using Beck's Depression Inventory-II. RESULTS: We found that almost half of the women in the group with T1DM and CAT presented with sexual dysfunction (49 vs. 33.7% in the control group; p = 0.025): 27.9 vs. 8.9 (p < 0.001)-desire, 23.1 vs. 7.9% (p = 0.003)-orgasm, 21.2 vs. 5.9% (p = 0.002)-lubrication, 17.3 vs. 6.9% (p = 0.023)-arousal, 9.6 vs. 1% (p = 0.006)-pain, and 20.2 vs. 9.9% (p = 0.040)-satisfaction problems. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that age was a significant risk factor for FSD, along with DM and body mass index. Coexisting CAT, polyneuropathy, depression, and the use of insulin pumps were significant risk factors for FSD. CONCLUSIONS: Women with T1DM and CAT are more likely to present with FSD than those without. It is important for patients to address depression, if present, and exercise caution while using insulin pumps. Moreover, DM complications such as polyneuropathy are significant risk factors for FSD; thus, it is crucial to ensure satisfactory glycemic control and optimal DM management.","10.1186/s13098-020-00602-7","","Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis; Depression; Female sexual dysfunction; Insulin pump; Polyneuropathy; Type 1 diabetes mellitus","Journal Article"

Accumulation of the unhydrolyzed substrate glucosylceramide within lysosomes results in progressive, multisystem Gaucher disease, classified into three types. Both parkinsonism and peripheral neuropathy are observed in cases of putative non-neuronopathic type 1 disease. In the current study we investigated whether the peripheral neural response in type 1 Gaucher disease patients, with no neural manifestations is conditioned by the influence of sex hormones. METHODS: The catalytic activity of b-glucocerebrosidase in peripheral blood leukocytes was determined spectrofluorometrically. Direct sequencing of the GBA1 gene was performed. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded after electrical stimulation of the median nerve of both arms. Stimuli of 0.2 ms duration at a frequency of 5 Hz were used. Sex hormones were determined by radioimmunoassay using a gamma scintillation counter. RESULTS: Analysis of the somatosensory evoked potentials revealed significant differences in peak latencies on periphery between men and women in both control and type 1 Gaucher disease groups. Analysis by gender showed significant associations between latencies and sex hormones only in female patients: negative correlation between oestradiol concentration and N9 peak latency, and a strong negative correlation of testosterone levels with all peak latencies on the periphery (N9-N13). CONCLUSIONS: A relationship between testosterone concentrations and the latencies of potentials evoked on peripheral nerves exists only in females with type 1 Gaucher disease. We point out sexual dimorphism in the development of this entity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven patients who were diagnosed as having ovarian cancer and treated between January 2005 and June 2010 with an expected survival time of at least 3 months, were enrolled into the study. The exclusion criteria were diagnoses of any disease that could disrupt consciousness and concurrent malignancies. The EORTC QLQ-OV28 module was translated into Turkish by professional translators and physicians. The test-retest reliability of the Turkish version of the questionnaire was performed on 30 patients. Answers were scored according to the instructions provided by the EORTC. The total score was calculated as explained above and after scoring procedures, all subscale scores were linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale. All patients concomitantly completed the Spielberg State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Patients were analyzed in two groups: on-treatment and off-treatment groups consisted of patients who did and did not undergo chemotherapy or surgery within the last two months, respectively. The demographic data of all patients were recorded. EORTC QLQ-OV28 scores of both groups were compared. Correlations between EORTC QLQ-OV28 subscales and total score of BDI and STAI were analyzed. RESULTS: For test-retest reliability, Spearman's rho was 0.84 (p<0.001). The on-treatment group scored statistically significantly higher than the offtreatment group in peripheral neuropathies, attitude to disease and treatment, sexual function and other chemotherapy adverse effect subscales of the questionnaire. Correlations between EORTC QLQ-OV28 subscales and the total scores of BDI and STAI of the groups were statistically significant, except the sexual function subscale. CONCLUSION: The Turkish translated version of EORTC QLQ-OV28 module is a reliable, consistent, and a valid instrument for assessing the impact of treatment modalities on QoL among Turkish speaking women with ovarian cancer.","10.4274/tjod.galenos.2020.26594","","EORTC; Quality of life; ovarian cancer","Journal Article"

The impact of both treatment arms on quality of life is reported in the present study. METHODS: Patients completed the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire QLQ-C30 and CX24 before treatment and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment. Linear mixed models were fitted to analyze differences in quality of life over time and between groups. Differences in mean quality of life scales >10 points and p<0.05 were considered clinically relevant and statistically significant, respectively. Inclusion criteria were: (1) histological diagnosis of locally advanced invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages IIB-IVA; (2) signed informed consent to participate in the CIRCE trial; and (3) answered at least one quality of life questionnaire. Excluded were patients who did not complete any quality of life questionnaire. Relevant exclusion criteria for the CIRCE trial included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >2 and peripheral neuropathy >2. Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to assess differences between groups in quality of life at baseline. To evaluate differences between treatment arms, linear mixed models were fitted using the transformed quality of life scores as a dependent variable and time of follow-up and study arm as factors. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were enrolled (n=55 neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm; n=52 chemoradiation arm). Quality of life compliance rates were higher for the chemoradiation group at every assessment time (ranging from 75-86.5% in the chemoradiation arm vs 55-81.8% in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm). For quality of life results at baseline, no statistically significant difference between the groups was seen. For both groups, most scales showed improvements over time, except for worsening of the summary score, sexual enjoyment, peripheral neuropathy, and menopausal symptoms. For chemoradiation, body image was lower (p<0.001) and patients presented more lymphedema (p<0.001) and sexual worry (p<0.001) at 12 months compared with baseline. Comparing study arms, neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed significantly lower scores in the menopausal symptoms scale (p=0.03) and higher scores for sexual/vaginal functioning (p=0.01). At 12 months, clinical differences were seen only for body image and menopausal symptoms scale, with neoadjuvant chemotherapy presenting better body image scores and a lower burden of menopausal symptoms. CONCLUSION: After treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer, patients improved in most quality of life aspects. However, worsening was observed in sexual enjoyment, peripheral neuropathy, and menopausal symptoms. To improve patients' quality of life, efforts should be made to prevent and treat these long term effects of locally advanced cervical cancer treatment.","10.1136/ijgc-2019-001134","Adult; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Carcinoma; Chemoradiotherapy; Cisplatin; Deoxycytidine; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Quality of Life; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Gemcitabine","quality of life (PRO)/palliative care; uterine cervical neoplasms","Clinical Trial, Phase II; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial"
32072096,"Persistent genital arousal disorder: a special sense neuropathy.","Oaklander AL; Sharma S; Kessler K; Price BH","Pain reports",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Persistent genital arousal (PGAD) is a syndrome of unprovoked sexual arousal/orgasm of uncertain cause primarily reported in female patients. Most patients are referred for mental-health treatment, but as research suggests associations with neurological symptoms and conditions, there is need to analyze cases comprehensively evaluated by neurologists. METHODS: The IRB waived consent requirements for this retrospective university-hospital study. We extracted and analyzed neurological symptoms, test, and treatment results from all qualifying participants' records and recontacted some for details. RESULTS: All 10 participants were female; their PGAD symptoms began between ages 11 to 70 years. Two patterns emerged: 80% reported daily out-of-context sexual arousal episodes (≤30/day) that usually included orgasm and 40% reported lesser, often longer-lasting, nonorgasmic arousals. Most also had symptoms consistent with sacral neuropathy-70% had urologic complaints and 60% had neuropathic perineal or buttock pain. In 90% of patients, diagnostic testing identified anatomically appropriate and plausibly causal neurological lesions. Sacral dorsal-root Tarlov cysts were most common (in 4), then sensory polyneuropathy (2). One had spina bifida occulta and another drug-withdrawal effect as apparently causal; lumbosacral disc herniation was suspected in another. Neurological treatments cured or significantly improved PGAD symptoms in 4/5 patients, including 2 cures. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by small size and referral bias to neurologists, this series strengthens associations with Tarlov cysts and sensory polyneuropathy and suggests new ones. We hypothesize that many cases of PGAD are caused by unprovoked firing of C-fibers in the regional special sensory neurons that subserve sexual arousal. Some PGAD symptoms may share pathophysiologic mechanisms with neuropathic pain and itch.","10.1097/PR9.0000000000000801","","C-fibers; Neuropathic pain; Pelvic pain; Peripheral neuropathy; Spinal cord; Tarlov cysts","Journal Article"

Little research exists on CRC symptoms or symptom management guidelines to support these individuals after cancer treatments. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to systematically review symptom experiences, risk factors, and the impact of symptoms and to examine the pooled frequency and severity of symptoms via meta-analyses in CRC survivors after cancer treatments. METHODS: Relevant studies were systematically searched in 7 databases from 2009 to 2019. Meta-analysis was conducted for pooled estimates of symptom frequency and severity. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. Six studies assessed multiple CRC symptoms, whereas 29 focused on a single symptom, including peripheral neuropathy, psychological distress, fatigue, body image distress, cognitive impairment, and insomnia. The pooled mean frequency was highest for body image distress (78.5%). On a scale of 0 to 100, the pooled mean severity was highest for fatigue (50.1). Gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and insomnia were also major problems in CRC survivors. Multiple factors contributed to adverse symptoms, such as younger age, female gender, and lack of family/social support. Symptoms negatively impacted quality of life, social and sexual functioning, financial status, and caregivers' physical and mental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer survivors experienced multiple adverse symptoms related to distinct risk factors. These symptoms negatively impacted patients and caregivers' well-being. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare providers can use study findings to better assess and monitor patient symptoms after cancer treatments. More research is needed on CRC-specific symptoms and their effective management.","10.1097/NCC.0000000000000785","Cancer Survivors; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans","","Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Systematic Review"

Many health disorders in male patients affect sexual activity by directly causing erectile dysfunction, affecting sexual motivation, or both. Clinical evidence indicates that many diseases strongly disrupt sexual motivation and sexual performance in patients with depression, addiction, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disturbances with obesity and diet-related factors, kidney and liver failure, circadian rhythm disorders, sleep disturbances including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, developmental and hormonal disorders, brain damages, cardiovascular diseases, and peripheral neuropathies. Preclinical studies of these conditions often require appropriate experimental paradigms, including animal models. Male sexual behavior and motivation have been intensively investigated over the last 80 years in animal rat model. Sexual motivation can be examined using such parameters as: anticipatory behavior and 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations reflecting the emotional state of rats, initiation of copulation, efficiency of copulation, or techniques of classical (pavlovian) and instrumental conditioning. In this review article, we analyze the behavioral parameters that describe the sexual motivation and sexual performance of male rats in the context of animal experimental models of human health disorders. Based on analysis of the parameters describing the heterogeneous and complex structure of sexual behavior in laboratory rodents, we propose an approach that is useful for delineating distinct mechanisms affecting sexual motivation and sexual performance in selected disease states and the efficacy of therapy in preclinical investigations.","10.3389/fnbeh.2019.00257","","anxiety; depression; general arousal; male behavior; metabolic disorders; sexual arousal; sexual motivation; ultrasonic vocalizations","Journal Article; Review"

Therefore, before starting a rehabilitative exercise program, the pain has to be reduced to enable the patient to participate actively in the exercise program. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT, the application of radial and/or focused shock waves with low or high energy) has been shown to be effective and efficient in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. However, one historical paradigm was the fact that, in the past, cancer was seen as a contraindication for the use of ESWT. METHODS: Clinical note to present indications, benefits, and contraindications of shock wave treatment in cancer patients. RESULTS: Malignant tumors in the treatment area have to be seen as a contraindication for the use of ESWT treatment. Cancer itself-in the form of the underlying disease-is not a contraindication for the treatment with radial and focused shock wave therapy with low or high energy. Plantar fasciitis and calcaneal spurs, calcified shoulder, tennis elbow or Achilles tendinopathy, and delayed healing and chronic wounds are typical approved standard indications for ESWT, and are allowed when the malignant tumor is not in the treatment area. There are also other musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal indications (e.g., myofascial syndrome, erectile dysfunction, polyneuropathy, and lymphedema) that are relevant for cancer survivors. These indications are recommended by the International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST) for ""common empirically tested clinical use"" and as exceptional indications/expert indications.

They are often used for prolonged (weeks to months) periods of time, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies, or in those who have received a solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Long-term use of azoles is associated with hepatotoxicity and hormone-related effects, including gynecomastia, alopecia, decreased libido, oligospermia, azoospermia, impotence, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and (rarely) adrenal insufficiency. Voriconazole and posaconazole have been associated with peripheral neuropathies, and itraconazole and voriconazole with pancreatitis. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with periostitis, phototoxic reactions, and squamous cell carcinoma. Since many at-risk patients are commonly receiving multiple medications, it can be difficult for care providers to identify antifungal agent causality or contribution to patient symptoms. Knowledge and recognition of adverse events caused by azoles, leading to dose reduction or discontinuation, can generally reverse these adverse events.","10.1007/s40265-019-01127-8","Antifungal Agents; Azoles; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Databases, Factual; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Time Factors","","Journal Article; Review"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible TCS were <55 years of age at diagnosis and treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Participants underwent physical examinations and completed questionnaires regarding 15 AHOs and health behaviors. Hypogonadism was defined as serum testosterone levels ≤3.0 ng/mL or use of testosterone replacement therapy. We investigated the role of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6258 and rs12150660) in the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) locus implicated in increased hypogonadism risk in the general population. RESULTS: Of 491 TCS (median age at assessment, 38.2 years; range, 18.7-68.4 years), 38.5% had hypogonadism. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis identified hypogonadism risk factors, including age at clinical evaluation (odds ratio [OR], 1.42 per 10-year increase; P= .006) and body mass index of 25 to <30 kg/m2 (OR, 2.08; P= .011) or ≥30 kg/m2 (OR, 2.36; P= .005) compared with <25 kg/m2. TCS with ≥2 risk alleles for the SHBG SNPs had a marginally significant increased hypogonadism risk (OR, 1.45; P= .09). Vigorous-intensity physical activity appeared protective (OR, 0.66; P= .07). Type of cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen and socioeconomic factors did not correlate with hypogonadism. Compared with TCS without hypogonadism, those with hypogonadism were more likely to report ≥2 AHOs (65% vs 51%; P= .003), to take medications for hypercholesterolemia (20.1% vs 6.0%; P<.001) or hypertension (18.5% vs 10.6%; P= .013), and to report erectile dysfunction (19.6% vs 11.9%; P= .018) or peripheral neuropathy (30.7% vs 22.5%; P= .041). A marginally significant trend for increased use of prescription medications for either diabetes (5.8% vs 2.6%; P= .07) or anxiety/depression (14.8% vs 9.3%; P= .06) was observed.

Practitioners knowledgeable about the evidence base behind common integrative approaches can help patients attain improved quality of life, and at times, improved survival. Evidence-based recommendations include the following: a plant-based diet for general health after diagnosis, and carbohydrate restriction for patients with estrogen receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer may be prudent. Other dietary recommendations include a 13-h daily overnight fast. Carefully selected patients may choose to fast the day before and the day of chemotherapy to decrease side effects. Specific food recommendations include avoidance or limitation of alcohol, and liberal culinary use of cruciferous vegetables, coffee, green tea, soy, and flaxseed. Promising supplements include diindolylmethane and melatonin. Omega 3 fatty acids may help with bone density in patients on aromatase inhibitors, but may increase chemotherapy resistance. Findings regarding the usefulness of multivitamins, vitamin D, vitamin C, and vitamin E are weak and/or mixed different exercise modalities may have different effects and thus play different roles in breast cancer therapy. Aerobic and resistance training combined during breast cancer chemotherapy may confer a survival benefit, while yoga may improve outcome in lymphedema patients. Current evidence suggests that meditation, yoga, breathing, music therapy, guided imagery, and hypnosis may improve mood and quality of life during breast cancer treatment. Acupuncture is useful for treating side effects of breast cancer therapies, including hot flushes, aromatase inhibitor-induced joint pain, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and vulvodynia. Vaginal moisturizers and vaginal rings supplying low-dose estrogen can be useful in the treatment of symptoms of estrogen-deprivation states caused by breast cancer treatments; such symptoms include vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and sexual dysfunction. Carbon dioxide laser technology can rejuvenate atrophied vaginal mucosa and relieve dyspareunia, allowing avoidance of estrogen therapy.

These include the prospective surveillance model, procedure-linked referrals, survivorship care plans, and risk stratification. Patients' capacity to engage in the rehabilitative process varies during cancer therapy and into survivorship. Perioperative attention generally focuses on managing premorbid impairments and normalizing shoulder function. In contrast, during chemotherapy and radiation therapy, symptom control, constructive coping, and role preservation may become more salient. Risk-stratified, individualized screening and prevention activities for specific impairments have become increasingly feasible through predictive models and analytics. Impairments' severity deleterious impact can be mitigated, as has been established for lymphedema, shoulder dysfunction, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, and sexual side effects.

Therefore, we substantiated the scarce knowledge regarding long-term QoL after breast cancer, burdensome problems, and unmet needs for more support. METHODS: Disease-free breast cancer survivors (n = 190) who had participated in two randomized controlled exercise trials during primary treatment were followed up to 5 years post-diagnosis. QoL-related functions and symptoms (EORTC QLQ-C30/-BR23), health problems, and support needs were assessed. EORTC-QLQ scores were compared with age-matched normative values from the general population in Germany. RESULTS: QoL-related functions and symptoms in patients during cancer treatment were worse compared to healthy references, but largely improved over time. Yet, cognitive function and sleep were still significantly impaired at 5-year follow-up. Other common long-term problems included sexual issues (45% of survivors), hot flashes (38%), pain (34%), fatigue (24%), and polyneuropathy (21%). Regression analyses indicated fatigue having the strongest impact on global QoL. Support needs were expressed mainly for menopausal disorders (43%), physical performance (39%), sleep problems (38%), arthralgia (37%), cognitive problems (36%), weight problems (32%), and fatigue (31%). CONCLUSIONS: While QoL in disease-free breast cancer survivors 5 years post-diagnosis was largely comparable to the general population on average, still many survivors suffered from adverse effects. There appears to be a need for ongoing screening and support regarding fatigue, sleep problems, cognitive problems, arthralgia/pain, menopausal/sexual symptoms, physical performance, and weight problems during and several years following breast cancer therapy.","10.1007/s11136-018-1866-8","Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires","Breast cancer survivors; Cognitive function; Fatigue; Long-term quality of life; Menopausal symptoms; Sleep problems","Journal Article"

Serological diagnosis is nonetheless critical because few patients have access to molecular diagnostics during the acute phase of infection and infection may be associated with only mild or inapparent disease that does not prompt molecular testing. Serological diagnosis is confounded by cross-reactivity of immune sera with other flaviviruses endemic in the areas where ZIKV has recently emerged. Accordingly, we built a high-density microarray comprising nonredundant 12-mer peptides that tile, with one-residue overlap, the proteomes of Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Ilheus, Oropouche, and chikungunya viruses. Serological analysis enabled discovery of a ZIKV NS2B 20-residue peptide that had high sensitivity (96.0%) and specificity (95.9%) versus natural infection with or vaccination against dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, or Japanese encephalitis virus in a microarray assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of early-convalescent-phase sera (2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptomatic infection).IMPORTANCE The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a teratogen is a profound challenge to global public health. Molecular diagnosis of infection is straightforward during the 3-week period when patients are viremic. However, serological diagnosis thereafter of historical exposure has been confounded by cross-reactivity. Using high-density peptide arrays that tile the proteomes of a selection of flaviviruses to identify a ZIKV-specific peptide, we established two assays that enable sensitive and specific diagnosis of exposure to ZIKV. These assays may be useful in guiding clinical management of mothers at risk for potential exposure to ZIKV and enable insights into the epidemiology of ZIKV infections.","10.1128/mBio.00095-18","Arboviruses; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Flavivirus; RNA, Viral; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Zika; arbovirus; emerging infectious diseases; flavivirus; serology","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Alike other flaviviruses, the principal mode of ZIKV transmission is by mosquitoes. Advances in research have provided reliable diagnostics for detecting ZIKV infection, while several drug/therapeutic targets and vaccine candidates have been identified recently. Despite these progresses, currently there is neither any effective drug nor any vaccine available against ZIKV. Under such circumstances and to tackle the problem at large, control measures of which mosquito population control need to be strengthened following appropriate mechanical, chemical, biological and genetic control measures. Apart from this, several other known modes of ZIKV transmission which have gained importance in recent past such as intrauterine, sexual intercourse, and blood-borne spread need to be checked and kept under control by adopting appropriate precautions and utmost care during sexual intercourse, blood transfusion and organ transplantation. The virus inactivation by pasteurization, detergents, chemicals, and filtration can effectively reduce viral load in plasma-derived medicinal products. Added to this, strengthening of the surveillance and monitoring of ZIKV as well as avoiding travel to Zika infected areas would aid in keeping viral infection under check. Here, we discuss the salient advances in the prevention and control strategies to combat ZIKV with a focus on highlighting various intervention approaches against the vector mosquitoes of this viral pathogen along with presenting an overview regarding human intervention measures to counter other modes of ZIKV transmission and spread. Additionally, owing to the success of vaccines for a number of infections globally, a separate section dealing with advances in ZIKV vaccines and transmission blocking vaccines has also been included.","10.3389/fmicb.2018.00087","","Zika fever; Zika virus; arbovirus; mosquito management; prevention; vector control","Journal Article; Review"

A literature review.","Cappuccio F; Rossetti S; Cavaliere C; Iovane G; Taibi R; D'Aniello C; Imbimbo C; Facchini S; Abate V; Barberio D; Facchini G","European review for medical and pharmacological sciences",2018,"OBJECTIVE: In this review, we focused our attention on Quality of Life (QoL) of testicular cancer survivors (TCSs), in general and in the most relevant areas. Several key findings have been highlighted in our review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were consulted to find published studies, from 1980 to May 2017, that met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The majority of studies investigated older adult TCSs, while few studies on adolescent and young adult patients were available. Many studies indicate that health-related QoL (HRQoL) is similar among the TCSs and the general population. Even if QoL deteriorates so clear at the time of diagnosis and throughout treatment, afterward returns to normal levels, as defined by the matched controls. However, there are numerous chronic conditions consequent to diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer that plague survivors and affect QoL, like Raynaud-like phenomena, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, anxiety, sexual, fertility and body image problems. Even if these problems can have no effects on the measures of global QoL, they have an impact on the quality of life. Differences between TCSs with and without a partner bring to different outcomes in the adjustments to cancer. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to identify TCSs with higher risks of poorer QoL outcomes, to focus interventions on the areas with the greatest impairments. Further researches should consider the effects of testicular cancer on the impaired areas, collecting more data to better identify survivor's needs and consequent interventions, with a special focus on adolescent and young adult TCSs. Other works are requested on therapies, preventive and ameliorative, to reduce chronic side effects of testicular cancer treatment.","10.26355/eurrev_201802_14290","Cancer Survivors; Chronic Disease; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Testicular Neoplasms","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

However, knowledge about its toxicity profile is mostly based on post-marketing observational studies. OBJECTIVES: Our study combines data from two prospective clinical trials designed to assess the safety of the drug newly produced by ELEA Laboratories (Abarax®). METHODS: Eligible participants were selected using a consecutive sampling strategy in the CINEBENZ and BIOMARCHA studies between 2013 and 2016 (EUDRACT 2011-002900-34 and 2012-002645-38, respectively, and clinicaltrials.gov NCT01755403 and NCT01755377, respectively). Enrolled subjects received treatment with 5 mg/kg/day benznidazole orally in two divided doses for 8 weeks and were followed up fortnightly. RESULTS: We observed 305 adverse reactions in 85 of 99 participants (85.9%). Each patient had a median of three adverse reactions, 89.5% were mild and the median duration was 12 days. Most adverse reactions appeared in the first month of treatment except arthritis and peripheral neuropathy. Twenty-six patients did not complete treatment: 2 were withdrawn, 1 for ectopic pregnancy and 1 for epilepsy relapse due to cysticercosis; 2 were lost to follow-up; and 22 were owing to adverse reactions, two of them severe. We observed some unexpected adverse reactions that have not been described previously, such as psychiatric symptoms, erectile dysfunction, menstrual cycle alterations and lung infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: There is a very high frequency of adverse reactions to benznidazole. Most adverse reactions are mild, but the treatment burden is significant and unexpected reactions are not rare. Severe reactions are uncommon, but they can be life-threatening. Further studies are necessary to optimize treatment.","10.1093/jac/dkx516","Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chagas Disease; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nitroimidazoles; Prospective Studies; Trypanocidal Agents; Young Adult","","Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

DESIGN AND SETTING: Guidelines were collected via experts and via literature database, guideline database and cancer agency websites searches. METHOD: EB guidelines in any language published between 2012 and 2017 were collected. EB recommendations on survivorship care relevant for PCPs were extracted and grouped into three categories (recurrence detection, long-term effects and recurrence prevention). The content of the recommendations was analysed and summarised in the number and type of clinical topics addressed. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the guidelines. RESULTS: Six guidelines, of which two were of acceptable methodological quality, were included. One was specifically made for general practitioners. Fifteen clinical topics were identified. Guidelines differed in the clinical topics addressed and for some identical topics in the content of the recommendations. Many recommendations were based on low-quality evidence. Recurrence detection received most attention, physical examination and mammography were often highlighted. Potential complications largely varied in number and type. Intimacy concerns, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, fatigue, menopausal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy and lymphedema were reported in more than one guideline. Recurrence prevention was mentioned in four guidelines; all recommended physical activity. CONCLUSION: The number of EB recommendations in guidelines is limited. Moreover, recommendations differ between guidelines and most are based on low-quality evidence. More high-quality research is needed to develop and adapt guidelines to support PCPs in providing optimal breast cancer survivorship care.","10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015118","Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; General Practitioners; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Primary Health Care","breast tumours; primary care","Journal Article; Review"

His medical background was unremarkable except for cigarette smoking and hyperlipidemia. Sjögren's syndrome was ruled out, and he was referred for evaluation of orthostatic hypotension, which by then included syncopal episodes and injuries. Additional symptoms included dry eyes, constipation, reduced sweating, and erectile dysfunction. After excluding medications and structural cardiac abnormalities as causes of orthostatic hypotension, a clinical autonomic evaluation was performed. The pattern of beat-to-beat blood pressure associated with performance of the Valsalva maneuver, and a low plasma norepinephrine level that did not increase in response to standing, established that the orthostatic hypotension was neurogenic. Treatment with an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist and fludrocortisone yielded partial improvement. After systemic diseases involving autonomic failure were excluded, cardiac sympathetic neuroimaging was performed by 123I-metaliodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning. The normal uptake seen in the heart indicated intact post ganglionic sympathetic innervation. There were no signs of central neurodegeneration or peripheral neuropathy. Because of symptoms and signs of both parasympathetic and sympathetic failure without denervation, an autonomic ganglionopathy was considered. A high titer of antibody to the neuronal nicotinic receptor, which mediates ganglionic neurotransmission, was obtained. The diagnosis of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) was made, and the management strategy shifted to first lowering the antibody burden by plasma exchanges and then instituting chronic anti-autoimmune treatment with rituximab and a low dose of cortiosteroid.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: Patients recruited into a nationwide cohort and assessed for prevalence and type of concomitant medication (including polypharmacy, defined as ≥5 concomitant medications), pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions, potential concomitant medication adverse effects and concomitant medication adherence. Factors associated with concomitant medication polypharmacy and with imperfect adherence were identified using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 522 participants, 392 (75%) took a concomitant medication (mostly cardiovascular, nonprescription or antidepressant). Overall, 280 participants (54%) had polypharmacy of concomitant medications and/or a drug interaction or contraindication. Polypharmacy was present in 122 (23%) and independently associated with clinical trial participation, renal impairment, major comorbidity, hospital/general practice-based HIV care (versus sexual health clinic) and benzodiazepine use. Seventeen participants (3%) took at least one concomitant medication contraindicated with their antiretroviral therapy, and 237 (45%) had at least one pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction. Concomitant medication use was significantly associated with sleep disturbance and myalgia, and polypharmacy of concomitant medications with diarrhoea, fatigue, myalgia and peripheral neuropathy. Sixty participants (12%) reported imperfect concomitant medication adherence, independently associated with requiring financial support, foregoing necessities for financial reasons, good/very good self-reported general health and at least 1 bed day for illness in the previous 12 months.

We investigated the symptom clusters and effects of symptom clusters on the quality of life of patients with ovarian cancer. METHOD: We recruited 210 ovarian cancer patients being treated with chemotherapy and used a descriptive cross-sectional study design to collect information on their symptoms. To determine inter-relationships among symptoms, a principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed based on the patient's symptoms (fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction). RESULTS: All patients had experienced at least two domains of concurrent symptoms, and there were two types of symptom clusters. The first symptom cluster consisted of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance symptoms, while the second symptom cluster consisted of pain and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy symptoms. Our subgroup cluster analysis showed that ovarian cancer patients with higher-scoring symptoms had significantly poorer quality of life in both symptom cluster 1 and 2 subgroups, with subgroup-specific patterns. The symptom clusters were different depending on age, age at disease onset, disease duration, recurrence, and performance status of patients with ovarian cancer. In addition, ovarian cancer patients experienced different symptom clusters according to cancer stage. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated that there is a specific pattern of symptom clusters, and symptom clusters negatively influence the quality of life in patients with ovarian cancer. Identifying symptom clusters of ovarian cancer patients may have clinical implications in improving symptom management.","10.1016/j.ejon.2017.07.007","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Ovarian Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Syndrome","Chemotherapy; Ovarian cancer; Quality of life; Symptom clusters","Journal Article"

Daily low dose (5 mg) of tadalafil has also been used for the treatment of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). PDE5 inhibitors induce relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the urethra, prostate, bladder neck, and blood vessels. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of tadalafil on vessels endothelial function, in patients with male LUTS symptoms associated with BPH. METHODS: The Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this clinical study and informed consents had been obtained from 81 BPH patients. The following male LUTS parameters: international prostate symptom score (IPSS), overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), voiding volume, max and mean voiding flow on voiding flowmetry examination and post-voiding residual urine (RU) were compared at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after a daily dose of 5 mg tadalafil. In addition, erectile function was evaluated by the sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) score and vessels endothelial function and peripheral neuropathy were assessed by the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), ankle brachial index (ABI), and vibration perception threshold (VPT) at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of 81 patients was 66.4 ± 11.4 years old. Their prostate size was 30.2 ± 22.1 ml. Male LUTS parameters including IPSS, OABSS, and RU showed significant improvement from 1 to 12 months after tadalafil administration. Max and mean voiding flow was significantly increased at 6 months after tadalafil treatment. The SHIM score showed significant improvement after 3 months. Whilst, the results of baPWV also showed significant improvement from 3 to 12 months. ABI was also significantly improved at 6 months. However, there was no change in the VPT at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: Tadalafil is effective for both male LUTS and ED. It is also shown that tadalafil improves baPWV, which we can conclude that higher vessels elasticity has been obtained. This major finding of this study shows that tadalafil has the potency to improve vessels endothelial dysfunction in patients with BPH.","10.1080/13685538.2017.1367922","Aged; Ankle Brachial Index; Endothelium, Vascular; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms; Male; Middle Aged; Penile Erection; Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors; Prospective Studies; Prostate; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Pulse Wave Analysis; Tadalafil","Tadalafil; endothelial function; erectile dysfunction; male lower urinary tract symptoms","Journal Article"

CR has been established as a non-genetic method of altering longevity and attenuating biological changes associated with aging. Aging is also an important risk factor for erectile dysfunction. The aim of this study was to examine whether CR diet can reverse the age-related alterations of erectile tissue in the aged rat. Four groups of rats were used: young rats (7 months) + ad libitum, aged rats (22 months) + ad libitum, young rats + CR diet, and aged rats + CR diet. The ad libitum group had free access to both food and water, and CR groups were fed 60% of the food intake of their ad libitum littermates, starting from 6 weeks before sacrifice. The penis was harvested and stained with antibodies to von Willebrand factor, smooth muscle α-actin, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, phospho-eNOS, nNOS, and neurofilament. We also performed Masson trichrome staining and TUNEL assay. The blood samples were collected for the measurement of serum total testosterone level. The contents of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and neuronal cells as well as serum testosterone levels were significantly lower in the penis of aged rats than in their young littermates. CR significantly restored cavernous endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and neuronal cell contents and decreased cavernous endothelial cell apoptosis and fibrosis in both young and aged rats. CR also increased serum testosterone level in aged rats, but not in young rats. CR successfully improved age-related derangements in penile neurovascular structures and hormonal disturbance. Along with a variety of lifestyle modifications, our study gave us a scientific rationale for CR as a non-pharmaceutical strategy to reprogram damaged erectile tissue toward neurovascular repair in aged men.","10.1111/andr.12401","Aging; Animals; Apoptosis; Caloric Restriction; Endothelium, Vascular; Erectile Dysfunction; Fibrosis; Male; Nerve Regeneration; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Penis; Phosphorylation; Rats; Testosterone","ageing/aging; angiopathy; calorie restriction; erectile dysfunction; peripheral neuropathy","Journal Article"

METHODS: A convenience sample of 39,088 SCPs completed for cancer survivors with an Internet-based SCP tool was examined; it included 5847 CC survivors (15%; CC was defined as chronic leukemia and/or recurrent/metastatic cancer of another nature). Patient-reported treatment effects and follow-up care patterns were compared between CC survivors and survivors treated with curative intent (CI). Responses from a follow-up survey regarding SCP satisfaction and use were reviewed. RESULTS: CC survivors had greater odds of experiencing multiple treatment-related effects than survivors treated with CI; these effects included fatigue, cognitive changes, dyspnea, peripheral neuropathy, lymphedema, and erectile dysfunction. Nearly half of CC survivors were managed by an oncologist alone, and they were less likely than CI patients to be comanaged by a primary care provider and an oncologist. Fewer SCPs were generated by health care providers (HCPs) for CC survivors versus CI survivors. A smaller proportion of CC users versus CI users rated their experience and satisfaction with the SCP tool as very good or excellent, and CC users were less likely to share the HCP summary with their health care team. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of CC survivors, often considered incurable but treatable, seek survivorship support. Tools to facilitate participation, communication, and coordination of care are valuable for these patients, and future iterations of SCPs should be designed to address the particular circumstances of living with CC.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 562 women treated with RT in our institution between 2003 and 2010 were reviewed. Excluding 259 women who died of disease or were lost to follow-up, disease status and late morbidities were evaluated in 303 LCCS. Quality of life (QoL) was analyzed in 168 LCCS using a questionnaire from the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer, and the results were compared with an age-matched healthy Korean female population. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 6.8 years (range 4.1-12.5 years). There were 14 deaths (7 cancer specific) and 14 recurrences (5 local recurrences and 9 distant metastases). The median time to recurrence was 6.0 years (range 4.1-8.2 years). Grade ≥2 late toxicities were frequently observed in the bladder (19%) and small/large intestine (15%). Multivariate analysis revealed a higher rate of late toxicity in patients aged ≥51 years at diagnosis (small/large intestine: hazard ratio, HR, 2.5 [1.2-5.5]; bladder: HR 2.4 [1.3-4.5]; and bone: HR 4.3 [1.2-15.8]) than patients aged <51 years.

World Health Organization declared the current outbreak as the public health emergency of international concerns. The major route of Zika virus transmission is mosquito bites. Sexual transmission and monkey bites are also observed in few cases. There is dire need to evaluate the other routes of transmission like blood transfusion, lactation and contact with body fluids. Zika virus is infecting infants, not only causing microcephaly but also creating number of complications resulting in bad outcomes of pregnancy. In Brazil alone, 4000 cases of microcephaly have observed during the current outbreak. The incidence of Guillain-Barre (GB) syndrome is also observed during the current Zika virus outbreak. GB syndrome is acute medical condition leading the patients to death due to weakness of respiratory muscles or can cause the life time disability. There is no anti-viral drug or vaccine available for Zika virus. Zika infection can be prevented by using mosquito repellents, mosquito nets, cooling rooms by air conditions and wearing full sleeves or permethrin-treated clothes.

DESIGN: The databases Embase classic+Embase, Global health, Ovid Medline and PsychINFO, were searched for relevant studies in June 2014 using the keywords: (Diabetes Mellitus OR diabetes mellitus type2 OR DM2 OR T2DM OR insulin resistance) AND (erectile dysfunction OR sexual dysfunction OR impotence) AND glycaemic control. SETTING: All study settings were considered (primary care, secondary care and tertiary care setting). PARTICIPANTS: Type 2 Diabetic Patients with erectile dysfunction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Included studies must include one of the following outcomes: (1) HBA1c for assess the level of glycaemic control; (2) Erectile dysfunction (any stage: IIEF-5 = 21 or less). RESULTS: Five cross-sectional studies involving 3299 patients were included. The findings pointed to a positive association between erectile dysfunction and glycaemic control. Three studies showed a significant positive association, while one study showed only a weak correlation and one study showed borderline significance. Patients' age, diabetes mellitus duration, peripheral neuropathy and body mass index had positive association with erectile dysfunction. However, smoking and hypertension were not associated with erectile dysfunction in most included studies. Physical activity had a protective effect against erectile dysfunction. CONCLUSION: We may conclude that the risk of erectile dysfunction is higher in type 2 diabetic men with poor glycaemic control than those with good control.","10.1177/2054270415622602","","clinical; diabetes; endocrinology; sexual health","Journal Article"

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In total, 744 patients at a median follow-up of 21 months were included. QoL was prospectively assessed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life core module 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC cervical cancer module 24 (CX24) questionnaires at baseline, then every 3 months during the first year, every 6 months in the second and third years, and finally yearly thereafter in patients with no evidence of disease. Outcomes were evaluated over time and compared to those from an age-matched female reference population. RESULTS: General QoL and emotional and social functioning were impaired at baseline but improved during the first 6 months after treatment, to reach a level comparable to that of the reference population, whereas cognitive functioning remained impaired. Both social and role functioning showed the lowest scores at baseline but which increased after treatment to reach a plateau at 6 months and then declined slightly at 3 and 4 years. The overall symptom experience was elevated at baseline and decreased to a level within the range of that of the reference population. Similarly, tumor-related symptoms (eg, pain, appetite loss, and constipation), which were present before treatment, decreased substantially at the first follow-up after treatment. Several treatment-related symptoms developed either immediately after and persisted over time (diarrhea, menopausal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and sexual functioning problems) or developed gradually after treatment (lymphedema and dyspnea). CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal prospective QoL analysis showed that patients' general QoL and functioning were impaired before treatment compared to those of reference data. Several tumor-related symptoms resolved after treatment, and functioning and general QoL returned to that of the level of the reference population, indicating a transient impact of diagnosis and treatment. However, several treatment-related symptoms and problems did develop and persist, either immediately or gradually after treatment.","10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.12.363","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brachytherapy; Chemoradiotherapy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Humans; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy, Image-Guided; Recovery of Function; Sexual Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Young Adult","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Quality of life has not been clearly defined up to date, although it is clear that it is a subjective self-assessment that to a significant extent is determined by individual needs, beliefs, values, attitudes, which are changing with time. Health-related QoL comprises basic dimensions such as patients' performance status, physical, emotional, and social functioning, symptoms of the disease and adverse effects of treatment, spiritual (God and existential) and other dimensions. In women, the ovary, cervical, corpus uterus, vagina and vulva cancers deteriorate QoL by disease progression and consequences of treatment, also in cancer survivors. Common symptoms include the genito-urinary system, the lower gastrointestinal tract and peripheral neuropathies induced by chemotherapy. In young women, QoL is impaired by infertility, sexual problems and menopause symptoms. An overview of QoL questionnaires used in oncology with special regard to patients with gynecological tumors was conducted. A screening tool for psychological state assessment of oncology patients (distress thermometer), the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and modular approach of QoL assessment recommended by the EORTC (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer) were presented. Practical guidelines were proposed to assess appropriately QoL in patients with gynecological cancers who stay at in-patient gynecology units and those treated at home and in an ambulatory care setting.","10.5114/pm.2015.56539","","gynecological cancer; oncology; quality of life; supportive care; symptoms","Journal Article; Review"

A Video Vignette Study.","Ngune I; Jiwa M; McManus A; Parsons R; Pagey G; Hodder R","Journal of medical Internet research",2015,"BACKGROUND: Patients who have been treated for colorectal cancer in Australia can consult their general practitioner (GP) for advice about symptoms or side effects at any time following their treatment. However, there is no evidence that such patients are consistently advised by GPs, and patients experience substantial unmet need for reassurance and advice. OBJECTIVE: To explore the patient management options selected by GPs to treat a set of patients describing their symptoms following treatment for colorectal cancer. METHODS: This was an Internet-based survey. Participants (GPs) viewed 6 video vignettes of actors representing patients who had been treated for colorectal cancer. The actor-patients presented problems that resulted from their treatment. Participants indicated their diagnosis and stated if they would prescribe, refer, or order tests, based on that diagnosis. These responses were then rated against the management decisions for those vignettes as recommended by a team of colorectal cancer experts. RESULTS: In total, 52 GPs consented to take part in the study, and 40 (77%) completed the study. Most GPs made a diagnosis of colorectal cancer treatment side effects/symptoms of recurrence that was consistent with the experts' opinions. However, correct diagnosis was dependent on the type of case viewed. Compared with radiation proctitis, GPs were more likely to recognize peripheral neuropathy (odds ratio, OR, 4.43, 95% CI 1.41-13.96, P=.011) and erectile dysfunction (OR 9.70, 95% CI 2.48-38.03, P=.001), but less likely to identify chemotherapy-induced fatigue (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08-0.44). GPs who had more hours of direct patient care (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.84, P=.02), were experienced (OR 9.78, 95% CI 1.18-8.84, P=.02), and consulted more patients per week (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.16-5.30, P=.02) suggested a management plan that was consistent with the expert opinion. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, years of experience and direct patient contact hours had a significant and positive impact on the management of patients. This study also showed promising results indicating that management of the common side effects of colorectal cancer treatment can be delegated to general practice. Such an intervention could support the application of shared models of care. However, a larger study, including the management of side effects in real patients, needs to be conducted before this can be safely recommended.","10.2196/jmir.4942","Adult; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease Management; Female; General Practitioners; Humans; Internet; Male; Pilot Projects","Internet survey; colorectal cancer; general practice; side effects; video vignettes","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

CASE REPORTS: We report two new cases of HAM/TSP in Caucasians, native from Galicia, Spain. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, clinical neurophysiologic studies and brain and spinal cord MRI scans were performed. Both patients presented a progressive chronic myelopathy, evolving to spastic paraparesis; one of them presenting with uveitis, prior to the onset of neurological symptoms. CSF analysis revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased protein concentration with positive anti-HTLV-1 antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction was positive for HTLV-1. Oligoclonal bands were not detected. In one of the patients, MRI scans did not reveal abnormalities whilst in the other there was an elongated high intensity lesion at the thoracic spinal cord level, which resolved after treatment. No evidence of peripheral neuropathy was found. Corticosteroids and interferon alpha therapy was started, with moderate functional improvement. A history of unprotected sexual relationships while travelling to HTLV-1 endemic areas was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1-associated uveitis may predict HAM/TSP. HAM/TSP is probably an underdiagnosed disease due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, insidious clinical presentation and low suspicion index in non-endemic regions for HTLV-1. In non-tropical countries, HAM/TSP should not only be suspected in migrants from endemic areas for HTLV-1, but also in patients from communities with a tradition of migration to tropical countries. TITLE: Paraparesia espastica tropical en una region no tropical. UNLABELLED: Introduccion. El virus linfotropo humano de celulas T tipo 1 (HTLV-1) es el agente causal de la paraparesia espastica tropical. Su prevalencia, elevada en determinadas areas tropicales, es baja en Europa y Norteamerica. Casos clinicos. Se describen dos casos de paraparesia espastica tropical en varones naturales y residentes en Galicia. Se realizaron estudios analiticos en la sangre y el liquido cefalorraquideo (LCR), examenes neurofisiologicos y resonancia magnetica craneal y medular. En ambos pacientes, la presentacion clinica fue la de una mielopatia cronica, con cuadro torpido y progresivo que evoluciono a paraparesia espastica. Un paciente desarrollo uveitis antes de la clinica neurologica. En los dos casos, el estudio del LCR demostro leve pleocitosis linfoide, ligera hiperproteinorraquia, bandas oligoclonales negativas y anticuerpos anti-HTLV-1 positivos. La reaccion en cadena de la polimerasa para HTLV-1 resulto positiva en ambos casos. La resonancia magnetica raquidea resulto normal en un paciente y mostro en el otro hiperseñal medular dorsal, que desaparecio tras el tratamiento. No se demostraron datos de polineuropatia periferica. Recibieron corticoides e interferon alfa, con leve mejoria y estabilizacion del cuadro clinico. La anamnesis dirigida revelo antecedentes de contactos sexuales de riesgo en regiones endemicas de HTLV-1. Conclusiones. La uveitis asociada a HTLV-1 podria ser predictora de paraparesia espastica tropical. Esta es probablemente una entidad infradiagnosticada (alto porcentaje de portadores asintomaticos, clinica insidiosa y bajo indice de sospecha en areas no endemicas).

Cervical cancer treatment of HIV-positive women poses challenges. Treatment-related changes in quality of life (QOL) of such women are important to future treatment protocols. AIM: To examine demographic data of HIV-negative and HIV-positive women at diagnosis of cervical cancer and describe their changes in QOL as a result of treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: All newly diagnosed patients with cervical cancer at Tygerberg Hospital were approached to participate in the study. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Cervix Cancer Module (QLQ-CX24) were used. General QOL was measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and cervical-specific QOL with the QLQ-CX24 questionnaire. The patients completed the questionnaire at diagnosis, on completion of treatment and at 3 months' follow-up. RESULTS: The study included a total of 221 women of whom 22% were HIV-positive; the latter were younger and of higher educational level than the rest. Mean monthly income and stage distribution was similar between the two groups. HIV-positive patients underwent radiation therapy more commonly than chemoradiation. HIV-positive women showed statistically significantly higher loss to follow-up during the study. HIV-positive women experienced no improvement in insomnia, appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, social role or any of the sexual domains. In contrast, HIV-negative women experienced statistically significant improvement in all sexual domains other than sexual/vaginal functioning. The QOL improvement of HIV-negative women was statistically significantly greater than their HIV-positive counterparts in the majority of QOL domains. Global health improved in both groups, with HIV-negative women experiencing greater improvement. HIV-positive women experienced an initial decline of peripheral neuropathy (PN) symptoms post treatment with a return to pretreatment values at 3 months' follow-up. The change in PN was statistically significant between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive women. CONCLUSION: Demographic differences exist between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive groups. The differential outcome in the QOL of HIV-positive and HIV-negative women treated for cervical cancer might be related to persistence of AIDS-related symptoms on completion of cervical cancer treatment.","10.4102/sajhivmed.v16i1.368","","","Journal Article"

26003257,"Genital and sexual pain in women.","Graziottin A; Gambini D; Bertolasi L","Handbook of clinical neurology",2015,"This chapter discusses the all too common problem of sex-related pain in women. Pain is a complex perceptive experience, involving biologic as well as psychologic and relational meanings. They become increasingly important with the chronicity of pain. Neurologists are quite aware of the painful aspect of many neurologic disorders, but lifelong and acquired genital and sexual pain is still neglected in a consistent percentage of women. One reason is the view - still held by many - that psychologic factors play the most important role in sex-related pain complaints. The consequences of diagnostic delay can be dramatic. Persisting tissue inflammation induces pain to change from acute and ""nociceptive,"" which indicates a ""friendly signal,"" alerting one to ongoing tissue damage, to chronic and ""neuropathic,"" a disease per se. Whilst the primary disease is progressing and neuroinflammation becomes a prominent feature, affected women have to bear years of pain and distress, huge quantifiable and non-quantifiable costs, and a progressive deterioration of personal and relational health and happiness. The scenario is even more dramatic when pain complicates an already disabling disease. The main aspects considered in this chapter include neuroinflammation as a key feature of pain; genital and sexual pain as part of neurologic diseases; and genital and sexual pain syndrome (dyspareunia and vaginismus) as primary problems, and their pelvic comorbidities (bladder pain syndrome, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, provoked vestibulodynia/vulvodynia). Finally, we discuss iatrogenic pain, i.e., genital and sexual pain caused by ill-conceived medical, surgical, pharmacologic or radiologic therapeutic interventions.","10.1016/B978-0-444-63247-0.00023-7","Female; Genital Diseases, Female; Humans; Pain; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological","Parkinson's disease; bladder pain syndrome; dyspareunia; endometriosis; iatrogenic genital pain; irritable bowel syndrome; mast cells; multiple sclerosis; neuroinflammation; peripheral neuropathies; provoked vestibulodynia/vulvodynia; sexual pain; vaginismus","Journal Article; Review"

A 29-year-old man with a 6-year history of diabetes mellitus was admitted to our hospital for poorly regulated diabetes and decreased libido. He was not an alcohol consumer. His family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed that he had a eunuchoid body shape. There was a symmetric excess fat accumulation in his submandibular, deltoid, nuchal, suprapubic and inguinal areas. He was diagnosed with Madelung's disease, and imaging studies supported the diagnosis. Hormonal evaluation revealed a hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Karyotype analysis revealed a 47,XXY mutation.

METHODS: The guidelines were developed by 26 scientific societies and two patient self-help organisations under the coordination of the Deutsche Schmerzgesellschaft (German Pain Society). A systematic literature search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline and Scopus databases (up until October 2013) was performed. Levels of evidence were assigned according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The strength of the recommendations was established by multistep formal procedures, in order to reach a consensus according to German Association of the Medical Scientific Societies (""Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlich Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften"", AWMF) regulations. The guidelines were reviewed by the Drug Commission of the German Medical Association, the Austrian Pain Society and the Swiss Association for the Study of Pain. RESULTS: Opioids are one drug-based treatment option for short- (4-12 weeks), intermediate- (13-25 weeks) and long-term (≥ 26 weeks) therapy of chronic osteoarthritis, diabetic polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia and low back pain. Contraindications are primary headaches, as well as functional somatic syndromes and mental disorders with the (cardinal) symptom pain. For all other clinical presentations, a short- and long-term therapy with opioid-containing analgesics should be evaluated on an individual basis. Long-term therapy with opioid-containing analgesics is associated with relevant risks (sexual disorders, increased mortality). CONCLUSION: Responsible application of opioid-containing analgesics requires consideration of possible indications and contraindications, as well as regular assessment of efficacy and adverse effects. Neither an uncritical increase in opioid application, nor the global rejection of opioid-containing analgesics is justified in patients with CNCP.","10.1007/s00482-014-1463-x","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Analgesics, Opioid; Chronic Pain; Consensus; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; Germany; Humans; Inappropriate Prescribing; Long-Term Care; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Young Adult","","Journal Article; Review"

METHODS: Our observational study involved a multidisciplinary surgical team that performed laparoscopy on 154 patients suffering from pelvic pain. Surgical complications occurring up to the 30th postoperative day were recorded. RESULTS: Mean age patient age was 34.1 years. Infertility was present in 69 (45%) although 31% had not attempted to get pregnant. Dysmenorrhea was the most frequent symptom (79.3%) followed by chronic pelvic pain (59.7%) and deep dyspareunia (48,7%). Most cases required extensive surgery as the majority (n=117; 76.9%) were classified as severe endometriosis (ASRM grade IV). The most frequent surgical procedures were: 136 adhesiolysis, 100 intestinal surgeries (85 retosigmoidectomies), 92 peritonal lesion excision, 39 vaginal resections, 19 myomectomies, 21 hysterectomies and 5 partial bladder resections. Postoperative complications were recorded in 14 (9.59%) patients: 8 (5.48%) major complications and 6 (4.11%) minor.

This study describes the long-term impact of liver surgery for CRC metastases on patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: The study used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30 and the disease-specific module, EORTC QLQ-LMC21. For functional scales, mean scores out of 100 with 95 per cent c.i. were calculated; differences of 10 points or more were considered clinically significant. Responses to symptom scales and items were categorized as 'minimal' or 'severe'. Proportions and 95 per cent c.i. for symptoms were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 241 patients were recruited; nine (3·7 per cent) had unresectable disease and were excluded. Some 68 (42 men) of 80 long-term survivors participated; their mean age was 69·5 years and median follow-up was 8·0 (range 6·9-9·2) years. Values for baseline and 1-year patient-reported outcome data were similar. Scores for functional scales were excellent (emotional function: 92, 95 per cent c.i. 87 to 96; social function: 94, 89 to 99; role function: 94, 90 to 98), reflecting clinically significant improvements from baseline values of 17 (10 to 24), 12 (3 to 21) and 12 (3 to 20) respectively.

Secondary causes of RLS and the characteristics of pediatric RLS are also discussed. Finally, management strategies for RLS are summarized. METHODS: The review began with a comprehensive PubMed search for 'restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease' in combination with the following: anxiety, arthritis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, cardiac, cardiovascular disease, comorbidities, depression, end-stage renal disease, erectile dysfunction, fibromyalgia, insomnia, kidney disease, liver disease, migraine, mood disorder, multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, neuropathy, obesity, pain, Parkinson's disease, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, psychiatric disorder, sleep disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and uremia. Additional papers were identified by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved publications. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical diagnosis of RLS can be straightforward, diagnostic challenges may arise when patients present with comorbid conditions. Comorbidities of RLS include insomnia, depressive and anxiety disorders, and pain disorders. Differential diagnosis is particularly important, as some of the medications used to treat insomnia and depression may exacerbate RLS symptoms. Appropriate diagnosis and management of RLS symptoms may benefit patient well-being and, in some cases, may lessen comorbid disease burden. Therefore, it is important that physicians are aware of the presence of RLS when treating patients with conditions that commonly co-occur with the disorder.","10.1185/03007995.2014.918029","Combined Modality Therapy; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Management; Humans; Restless Legs Syndrome","Comorbidities; Depression; End-stage renal disease; Insomnia; Pain; Pregnancy; Restless legs syndrome","Journal Article; Review"

Close to the threshold of statistical significance are the CD4 nadir (97,33±65,6 vs 123,15±43,35 cells/mm3, p=0.058) and duration of use of d-drugs (22,5±31,94 vs 12,24±8,6 months, p=0.057). Odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) increase with age. ROC analysis for the study group establishes a threshold difference of 29 years (sensitivity 50%, specificity 80%). CONCLUSIONS: higher age and advanced immunosupression are the most important risk factors for developing symptomatic peripheral neuropathy in Romanian HIV infected patients; taking into account the small number of cases studied, although not statistically significant, it should be noted the CD4 nadir and the length of d-drug use.","10.12865/CHSJ.40.01.07","","HIV; peripheral neuropathy; risk factors","Journal Article"

Recent studies have shown that ED can be the forerunner of serious cardiovascular disturbances. It has also been reported that peripheral neuropathy and microvascular injuries caused by pathophysiological changes in patients with diabetes and obesity lead to ED in a significant number of such cases. These patients develop clinically significant ED and comprise a significant portion of the patient group which do not respond to PDE-5 inhibitors. Testosterone has been shown to increase the expression of PDE-5. This function of testosterone supports its effect on the regulation of erection and increasing the sexual libido. In view of the complexity of ED, as well as the effect of testosterone on erection, it is concluded that PDE-5 inhibitors in combination with testosterone replacement would be a better therapy alternative in the management of erectile dysfunction in hypogonadal patients.","10.5812/numonthly.11523","","Erectile Dysfunction; Testosterone; Therapeutics","Journal Article; Review"

Unlike other current treatment options for ED, all of which are palliative in nature, LI-ESWT is unique in that it aims to restore the erectile mechanism in order to enable natural or spontaneous erections. Results from basic science experiments have provided evidence that LI-ESWT induces cellular microtrauma, which in turn stimulates the release of angiogenic factors and the subsequent neovascularization of the treated tissue. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been clinically investigated and applied in several medical fields with various degrees of success. High-intensity shock wave therapy is used for lithotripsy because of its focused mechanical destructive nature, and medium-intensity shock waves have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and are used for treating a wide array of orthopedic conditions, such as non-union fractures, tendonitis, and bursitis. In contrast, LI-ESWT has angiogenetic properties and is therefore used in the management of chronic wounds, peripheral neuropathy, and in cardiac neovascularization. As a result of these characteristics we initiated a series of experiments evaluating the effect of LI-ESWT on the cavernosal tissue of patients with vasculogenic ED. The results of our studies, which also included a double-blind randomized control trial, confirm that LI-ESWT generates a significant clinical improvement of erectile function and a significant improvement in penile hemodynamics without any adverse effects. Although further extensive research is needed, LI-ESWT may create a new standard of care for men with vasculogenic ED.","10.1177/1756287212470696","","erectile dysfunction; male impotence; shockwaves; therapy","Journal Article"

A prospective study.","Plotti F; Nelaj E; Sansone M; Antonelli E; Altavilla T; Angioli R; Benedetti Panici P","The journal of sexual medicine",2012,"INTRODUCTION: When cervical cancer is detected at an early stage (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] IA2-IB1), it can be successfully treated by radical surgery alone. Considering that most patients are young and sexually active at the moment of diagnosis and the long life expectancy of survivors after the treatment, quality of life (QoL) and sexual function are important issues for cancer survivors and caregivers. However, only a few studies have examined the QoL and sexual function in disease-free cervical cancer survivors, and there are no studies in the literature comparing prospectively sexual function after different types of radical hysterectomy. AIM: To compare sexual function in two groups of early stage cervical cancer survivors treated by radical surgery alone, undergoing two different types of radical hysterectomy. METHODS: Patients treated by radical hysterectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy for early stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2-IB1) have been enrolled and divided in two groups with regard to type of radical hysterectomy performed; S1: modified radical hysterectomy (Piver II/Type B), S2: classic radical hysterectomy (Piver III/ Type C2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Twenty-four months after surgery we assessed the sexual function using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Cervix Cancer Module Questionnaire, which is a validated system for the assessment of disease- and treatment-specific issues that affect the QoL and sexual functioning of women who are treated for cervical cancer. RESULTS: Of the 31 patients enrolled in the S1 group and 46 in the S2 group, 23 and 33 patients have been included, respectively. We observed significant differences between the two groups in terms of symptom experience, sexual/vaginal functioning, sexual activity, and sexual enjoyment. There was not any significant difference regarding lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, and sexual worry.

METHODS: Women attending follow-up clinic at Hammersmith Hospital having undergone treatment for primary or relapsed ovarian cancer were asked to complete two validated questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OV28) and a ""wellbeing thermometer"". Results were assessed and stratified by patient age, tumour stage, relapse status, type of chemotherapy received and treatment-free interval. Symptoms reported in questionnaires were compared to those documented in patients' hospital notes. RESULTS: Of 116 women approached, 100 (86%) participated in this study and had received chemotherapy for ovarian cancer between 2003 and 2010. The most frequently described and severe symptoms reported in the questionnaires were emotional symptoms, negative feelings about treatment or prognosis, fatigue and pain. Dyspareunia, cognitive impairment and peripheral neuropathy were also frequently described. Symptom severity was independent of variables such as disease stage, type of chemotherapy received and relapse status. The ""wellbeing thermometer"" scores closely correlated with pain, fatigue, weakness, gastrointestinal symptoms and attitude to disease or treatment (p<0.001). There was a marked discordance between questionnaire-reported symptoms and those recorded in hospital notes.

Patient reported outcomes are essential in capturing patients' experiences in order to address survivorship issues; however, patient reported toxicities are not often collected or reported. METHODS: A web-based survivorship care plan tool was used to collect patient reported toxicity data for 390 women who had undergone treatment for gynecological cancer. Demographic, diagnosis, treatment modality and toxicity data were reviewed. RESULTS: Median age of diagnosis was 49 years, and 88% (n=334) of the women were Caucasian and had attended at least some college. Only 10% (n=38) had previously been offered a survivorship care plan or survivorship information. Almost half of the patients had ovarian cancer (46%, n=180), 23% had cervical cancer (n=92) and 28% had uterine cancer (n=109). Late effects most commonly reported for all gynecological malignancy survivors using this tool were cognitive changes, sexual side effects, changes in bowel patterns, peripheral neuropathy and skin changes. CONCLUSION: Women with gynecological cancers experience a plethora of late effects; however, very few of them have access to a survivorship plan to cope with these issues. Patient reported side effects, especially sexual dysfunction, occur more commonly than previously reported. Patient-focused tools to evaluate these side effects and access to survivorship plans are needed for comprehensive care of gynecologic cancer survivors.","10.1016/j.ygyno.2011.11.034","Adolescent; Adult; Aftercare; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Social Class; Survivors; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

METHODS: A systematic literature review process was used. This focused on published reviews to enable a fast but rigorous identification of both the gaps and well-researched areas within survivorship. RESULTS: The search identified 5121 reviews, of which 42 were screened and 9 met the quality and inclusion criteria. The majority of papers focused on physical well being (n = 6) with the remaining papers focusing on practical well being (employment and finance). The quality of the reviews varied (ranging from weak to good). Gaps identified include sexual function, lower-limb lymphoedema, peripheral neuropathy, bladder and GI problems, hormonal sequelae, older cancer survivors, work impact of cancer and context-specific unmet supportive care needs. The review found a lack of standardised nomenclature for survivorship and methodological limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Four main gaps in knowledge relating to the practical and physical problems associated with cancer survivorship have been identified. These are key symptoms, unmet supportive care needs, employment and older cancer survivors, and should be addressed by future research and systematic literature reviews. Work is also needed to address the nomenclature of survivorship and to improve the methodology of research into cancer survivors (including standardised measures, theoretical frameworks, longitudinal design, inclusion of older survivors and age-matched controls for comparison).

AIM: The objective of this study is to evaluate the sexual function in a cervical cancer patient's group treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) plus type C2/type III radical hysterectomy (RH). METHODS: We have enrolled in the oncologic group (OG) sexually active patients affected by cervical cancer (stage IB2 to IIIB) treated with NACT followed by RH.

To investigate functional genomic consequences of these differences, we compared their physiological levels of phytanic acid, a branched chain fatty acid that can be derived from the microbial degradation of chlorophyll in ruminant guts. Humans who accumulate large stores of phytanic acid commonly develop cerebellar ataxia, peripheral polyneuropathy, and retinitis pigmentosa in addition to other medical conditions. Furthermore, phytanic acid is an activator of the PPAR-alpha transcription factor that influences the expression of genes relevant to lipid metabolism. RESULTS: Despite their trace dietary phytanic acid intake, all great ape species had elevated red blood cell (RBC) phytanic acid levels relative to humans on diverse diets. Unlike humans, chimpanzees showed sexual dimorphism in RBC phytanic acid levels, which were higher in males relative to females. Cultured skin fibroblasts from all species had a robust capacity to degrade phytanic acid. We provide indirect evidence that great apes, in contrast to humans, derive significant amounts of phytanic acid from the hindgut fermentation of plant materials. This would represent a novel reduction of metabolic activity in humans relative to the great apes. CONCLUSION: We identified differences in the physiological levels of phytanic acid in humans and great apes and propose this is causally related to their gut anatomies and microbiomes. Phytanic acid levels could contribute to cross-species and sex-specific differences in human and great ape transcriptomes, especially those related to lipid metabolism. Based on the medical conditions caused by phytanic acid accumulation, we suggest that differences in phytanic acid metabolism could influence the functions of human and great ape nervous, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems.","10.1186/1472-6793-10-19","Animals; Erythrocytes; Female; Gene Expression; Gorilla gorilla; Hominidae; Humans; Intestines; Male; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Phytanic Acid; Pongo pygmaeus","","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

Our aim was to develop a conceptual framework of PROs for hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) to support measurement clarity. METHODS: Relevant outcome issues were identified from review of recent clinical trials. This provided content for an interview with 15 metastatic HRPC patients and a survey of 10 practitioners. All participants were asked about the relevance and importance of 26 outcomes and were allowed to nominate new outcomes. Practitioners were also asked to determine which outcomes endorsed by patients were attributable to the disease (symptoms) versus treatment (side effects). Analyses of archived clinical trial data were used to verify and augment the interview and survey results. RESULTS: Patients endorsed 11 concerns as relevant and important to HRPC including general pain, bone pain, urinary problems, fatigue, appetite loss, constipation, erectile dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, PSA anxiety, and changes in self image. Practitioner judgments helped classify each concern into one of four categories, disease symptom, treatment side effect, both symptom and side effect, or psychological concern. Additionally, patients endorsed (and practitioners confirmed) the relevance and importance of several general domains of quality of life. Analyses of archived data confirmed the importance of these issues and suggested two additional concerns. CONCLUSION: Findings were used to propose a conceptual framework of PROs for metastatic HRPC.

Primary care continues to be predominantly delivered by high caseload general practitioners and specialists, but GPs with limited HIV experience are increasingly likely to have contact with HIV positive patients through shared care arrangements. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to review the management of stable patients with HIV and to provide an approach to important elements of their ongoing care. DISCUSSION: The long term care of people living with HIV is increasingly focused on chronic disease management and health promotion.

19747114,"Sexual dimorphism in autoimmune disease.","McCombe PA; Greer JM; Mackay IR","Current molecular medicine",2009,"We briefly survey the concept of autoimmunity and nominate the range of autoimmune diseases that include multisystemic and organ-specific disorders, and cite prevalences of autoimmune diseases in males and females, in humans and in experimental animals. Most human autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS) and autoimmune thyroid disease, have an increased incidence and prevalence in females, but a few others such as autoimmune diabetes, the Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) and psoriasis are increased in males. Animal models of autoimmunity show an equivalent sexual dimorphism. The possible reasons for the differing incidence and prevalence of autoimmune diseases in females and males engage our attention. Environmental exposures may differ for females and males. There are innate differences in the function of the female and male immune systems, and there is some evidence for differences between females and males in the ability of a target organ for autoimmunity to withstand damage. In seeking reasons for these differences, we review the role of sex hormones in immunity and include results of trials of hormone therapy in autoimmune diseases. The association of autoimmunity and pregnancy, a female-specific condition, is discussed, and the claimed effects of lymphoid cell microchimerism on provocation of autoimmunity are reviewed. Genetic predisposition is an important factor in autoimmune disease and we particularly focus on genes on the X and Y chromosomes, the role of X chromosome inactivation, and the interaction of the sex of the patient with other genetic factors. The possible role of epigenetic mechanisms, including environmental influences, is then surveyed. We assert that sex is a vital variable that must be considered in all immunological studies, as it should be at all levels of biological research.","10.2174/156652409789839116","Autoimmune Diseases; Female; Humans; Male; Sex Characteristics","","Journal Article; Review"
19412812,"The personality trait of neuroticism is strongly associated with long-term morbidity in testicular cancer survivors.","Grov EK; Fosså SD; Bremnes RM; Dahl O; Klepp O; Wist E; Dahl AA","Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",2009,"BACKGROUND: Neuroticism is a personality trait expressing nervousness and insecurity. Associations between neuroticism and morbidity in long-term cancer survivors have hardly been explored. The aim of this study was to explore associations between neuroticism and somatic and mental morbidity and lifestyle issues in long-term survivors of testicular cancer (TCSs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: All Norwegian TCSs treated between 1980 and 1994 (n = 1 814) were invited to this cross-sectional study. Among them 1 428 (79% response rate) delivered valid data. Neuroticism was self-rated on an abridged version of the Eysenck Personality Inventory. Information was collected by mailed questionnaires. The associations of neuroticism and self-reported variables were tested with multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Neuroticism was significantly associated with presence of somatic complaints, reduced physical function, neurotoxic side-effects (tinnitus, hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and Raynaud's Phenomenon), self-esteem, concerns about not being able to father children, sexual problems, hazardous alcohol use, daily use of medication, use of sedatives and hypnotics, recent visits to a general practitioner, and seeing a psychologist/ psychiatrist after ended cancer treatment. Poor self-rated health, higher number of negative life events, economical problems and problems getting loans granted showed significant associations with neuroticism. DISCUSSION: Neuroticism in TCSs at long-term follow-up is significantly associated with somatic and mental morbidities, and several aspects of unhealthy lifestyle. High levels of neuroticism should be considered in TCSs expressing multiple complaints and concerns at follow-up consultations. Assessment of neuroticism may be clinically important in order to offer appropriate interventions to prevent and manage morbidity in TCSs.","10.1080/02841860902795232","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Neurotic Disorders; Norway; Personality Inventory; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Self Concept; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survival Rate; Survivors; Testicular Neoplasms; Time Factors; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

Increasing awareness, particularly through the media, is inducing more men to seek help for this condition. Erectile dysfunction is defined as the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection adequate for satisfactory sexual activity. The prevalence increases with age. Basic and clinical research is identifying the neurovascular and humoral control of the mechanisms. The initial evaluation should differentiate erectile dysfunction from premature ejaculation and loss of libido. Myocardial insufficiency, hypogonadism and peripheral neuropathy should be looked for. Initial laboratory investigations should be restricted to identifying previously undetected medical illness that may directly contribute to erectile dysfunction. Discussing the available options with the couple is an important aspect. If erectile dysfunction is secondary to other treatable disorders these should be treated simultaneously. When other diseases that require intervention are ruled out and if there are no contraindications, therapy may be initiated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In selected cases, psychosexual therapy may be beneficial. If phosphodiesterase inhibitors are contraindicated, vacuum constriction devices may be tried. Further options include intracavemosal injection, intraurethral instillation, penile revascularization and prosthesis. The availability of effective and well-tolerated oral medications has dramatically changed the clinical approach to erectile dysfunction. Pharmacotherapy is the preferred cost-effective first-line therapy in the vast majority of patients. A stepped-care approach is followed in the primary care and family practice settings.

In addition, much controversy surrounds the differences in manifestations of SLE in both sexes. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the possible etiologies of the greater prevalence of SLE in females, as well as the differences in the clinical presentation of the disease in both sexes. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through a PubMed search for articles published between 1960 and 2001; no language restrictions were applied. Search terms included lupus, SLE, and gender differences. Books and online resources were also consulted. RESULTS: Potential causes of the female predilection for SLE included the effects of estrogen and its hydroxylation, decreased androgen levels, hyperprolactinemia, and differences in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling. Clinical manifestations of SLE included females having more frequent relapses, but the incidence of severe relapses was the same in both sexes. Raynaud phenomenon, arthritis, and leukopenia were more common in women, whereas skin manifestations, serositis, and renal involvement were more common in men. For neurologic manifestations, females with SLE experienced more psychiatric symptoms and headaches, whereas males with SLE experienced more seizures and peripheral neuropathy. Males with SLE also tended to have more severe renal disease and cardiorespiratory involvement. CONCLUSIONS: The increased frequency of SLE among women may be attributed to differences in the metabolism of sex hormones and/or GnRH. Though less common in men, when it does occur SLE tends to run a more severe course-an important consideration in the diagnosis and follow-up of male patients with SLE.","10.1016/s1550-8579(04)80006-8","Female; Hormones; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Sex Factors","","Journal Article; Review"

Because of the high incidence of intolerable side effects observed with protease inhibitor- and zidovudine-based NPEP regimens, our unit changed standard NPEP treatment to 28 days of tenofovir-lamivudine-stavudine (TDF-3TC-d4T). The aim of this study was to compare side effects and numbers of individuals completing NPEP before and after this change. METHODS: Parameters were compared amongst individuals commencing the following NPEP regimens: zidovudine-lamivudine (ZDV-3TC), zidovudine-lamivudine-nelfinavir (ZDV-3TC-NFV) and TDF-3TC-d4T. RESULTS: A total of 385 individuals received ZDV-3TC (n = 36), ZDV-3TC-NFV (n = 225) or TDF-3TC-d4T (n = 137) as NPEP for the first time between June 1999 and November 2003. Noncompletion rates were 25%, 32% and 15%, respectively (P = 0.001), with odds ratios for noncompletion being 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-4.8] and 2.7 (95% CI 1.6-4.8) in the first two groups compared with the TDF-3TC-d4T group (P = 0.008). Adverse events were less common in the TDF-3TC-d4T group, with significantly lower rates of nausea and headache, but significantly higher rates of peripheral neuropathy and asymptomatic raised transaminases.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were 1,408 TCSs treated between 1980 and 1994 in Norway. Participants provided information about their medical, social, and familial situation on a questionnaire. They also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Anxiety disorder and depression were defined by a score >/= 8 on the HADS subscales. The prevalence rates were compared with age-adjusted norm data. RESULTS: HADS-defined anxiety disorder was more prevalent in TCSs (19.2%; 95% CI, 17.2% to 21.3%) than in the norm sample (13.5%; 95% CI, 13.1% to 13.9%; P < .001), whereas the prevalence of HADS-defined depression did not differ from the norm (TCSs, 9.7%; 95% CI, 8.1% to 11.2% v norm, 10.1%, 95% CI, 9.5 to 10.5; P = .56). The relative risk for anxiety disorder was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.31 to 1.69) and for depression the relative risk was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.14) in TCSs compared with norm. In multivariate analyses, HADS-defined anxiety disorder in TCSs was associated with young age, peripheral neuropathy, economic problems, alcohol problems, sexual problems, relapse anxiety, and having been treated for mental problems. CONCLUSION: Long-term TCSs have an increased risk of HADS-defined anxiety disorder that warrants clinical attention. Checking easily available demographic and TC-related data and use of a simple screening test such as HADS assists the identification of TCSs with anxiety disorder.","10.1200/JCO.2005.05.061","Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Depression; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Survivors; Testicular Neoplasms","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

There are a number of surgical procedures for the treatment of morbid obesity, including purely gastric restrictive, a combination of malabsorption and gastric restriction or primary malabsorption. The purely gastric restrictive procedures, including vertical banded gastroplasty and laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding, do not provide adequate weight loss. African-American patients do especially poorly after the banding procedure with the loss of only 11% of excess weight in one study. Gastric bypass (GBP) is associated with the loss of 66% of excess weight at 1 to 2 years after surgery, 60% at 5 years and 50% at 10 years. For unknown reasons, African-American patients lose significantly less weight than Caucasians after GBP. There is a risk of micronutrient deficiencies after GBP, including iron deficiency anemia in menstruating women, vitamin B12, and calcium deficiencies. Prophylactic supplementation of these nutrients is necessary. Recurrent vomiting after bariatric surgery may be associated with a severe polyneuropathy and must be aggressively treated with endoscopic dilatation before this complication is allowed to develop. The malabsorptive procedures include the partial biliopancreatic bypass (BPD) and BPD with duodenal switch (BPD/DS). The BPD appears to cause severe protein-calorie malnutrition in American patients; the BPD/DS may be associated with less malnutrition. Weight loss failure after GBP does not respond to tightening a dilated gastrojejunal stoma or reducing the size of the gastric pouch. These patients may require conversion to a malabsorptive distal GBP, similar to the BPD. However, because of the risk of severe protein-calorie malnutrition and calcium deficiency BPD should be reserved for patients with severe obesity comorbidity. The risk of death following bariatric surgery is between 1% and 2% in most series but is significantly higher in patients with respiratory insufficiency of obesity. In most patients, surgically induced weight loss will correct hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, venous stasis disease, urinary incontinence, female sexual hormone dysfunction, pseudotumor cerebri, degenerative joint disease pains, as well as improved self-image and employability.",NA,"Adult; Biliopancreatic Diversion; Black People; Female; Gastric Bypass; Gastroplasty; Humans; Jejunoileal Bypass; Male; Obesity, Morbid; Postoperative Complications; Weight Loss; Black or African American","","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Review"

History of alcohol abuse as well as drinking behaviour in the last 6 months were assessed by a semi-structured interview. Findings included intensive clinical examination with abdominal ultrasound in most subjects. Heavy drinking with frequent inebriation was most often found in our sample (44.4%), whereas continuous heavy alcohol consumption without intoxication (33.6%), and an episodic drinking style (22.0%) were less frequent. The heavy drinkers suffered more often from pancreatitis, oesophageal varices, polyneuropathy or erectile dysfunction than episodic drinkers. They also showed more upper gastrointestinal disorders, although the estimated life-time alcohol intake was comparable to continuous drinkers. No difference relating to withdrawal delirium or seizures could be found between the groups of alcoholics. Frequent heavy drinkers showed a trend to more alcohol-related medical disorders than alcoholics with a different drinking pattern, although they were younger and their estimated life-time alcohol intake was comparable to that of continuous drinkers.

9586618,"Unusual complications of the vacuum erection device.","Ganem JP; Lucey DT; Janosko EO; Carson CC","Urology",1998,"OBJECTIVES: The vacuum erection device (VED) is usually well tolerated and very effective for patients with erectile dysfunction. When used correctly, VEDs carry low morbidity and few recognized complications. We report on 5 patients who developed unusual complications associated with VED use, including two previously unreported complications of urethral bleeding and capture of scrotal tunica within the penile shaft. METHODS: Patient 1: a 38-year-old diabetic man with significant peripheral neuropathy and an 8-year history of erectile dysfunction developed penile skin necrosis at the ring site after leaving the penile ring on for an excessive length of time (6 hours). Patient 2: a 76-year-old diabetic man who used a VED correctly for 3 months developed severe urethral bleeding. Patient 3: a 75-year-old diabetic man who enjoyed satisfactory erections with a VED for 14 months developed a 3 x 3-cm penile cystic mass located on the proximal right side of the penile shaft. This mass was not present in the flaccid state and was seen only with VED use. Patient 4: a 65-year-old man developed Peyronie's disease after 4 years of correct VED use. Patient 5: a 62-year-old man with neurogenic impotence following a radical prostatectomy developed penile ecchymoses acutely following placement of a smaller constriction ring. He subsequently developed a dorsal penile plaque with mild dorsal curvature. RESULTS: Patient 1 did well with local skin care and no longer uses a VED. Patient 2 underwent cystoscopy and was found to have prominent urethral vessels (varicosities) in the midurethra, compared with a normal cystoscopy 9 months previously. This patient no longer uses a VED and now denies any urethral bleeding at 15-month follow-up. Patient 3 underwent corpora cavernosography and contrast injection of the cystic mass. These radiographic studies showed that the mass did not communicate with either corpora cavernosa or the corpus spongiosum. A retrograde urethrogram failed to show a urethral diverticulum. The patient was surgically explored, and the penile cystic mass was found to be scrotal tunica vaginalis. Subsequently, a hydrocele repair was performed, yet postoperatively the patient developed testicular migration into the ipsilateral penile shaft. Testicular fixation was not feasible secondary to a childhood herniorrhaphy, and an orchiectomy was performed. Patient 4 underwent implantation of a penile prosthesis and is doing well at 3-year follow-up.

Thalidomide was first developed and marketed in Germany in the 1950s as a sedative. It was withdrawn in 1962 when it was recognized to cause birth defects. Possessing no antibacterial activity, thalidomide is now used to treat a variety of diseases with an autoimmune character. It is unclear how it works to modulate the immune system or whether or not it will accelerate the deterioration of the immunological status of HIV-positive patients. One study suggests that it may suppress HIV viral replication and decrease viral burden. Thalidomide inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF). It affects the nervous system, often causing side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, decreased libido and mood changes, as well as peripheral neuropathy. However, most of the neuropathy cases occurred in patients who had received a high dose for longer than six months. Response to thalidomide occurs at doses ranging from 100mg a day to 400 mg a day, with ulcer pain resolving within two to four days. Randomized placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of thalidomide in HIV-positive persons with aphthous ulcers.

1568358,"Biological aspects of HIV infection.","Macchi B; Petruzzelli MA; De Laurenzi V","La Clinica terapeutica",1992,"In the present paper the authors review the biological properties of the HIV infection. The preferential target of HIV infection is the lymphocyte that expresses the CD4 phenotype. Infection of CD4 subsets leads to a remarkable cytopathic effect that can be blocked by antibodies anti CD4 epitope. Actually the HIV envelope proteins recognize an epitope of the CD4 surface molecules; as consequence the antibodies anti idiotypic directed to CD4 indirectly present the binding of envelope proteins to CD4. The relationship between this retrovirus and the immunological pathogenesis of the disease are also discussed. HIV infection is facilitated in groups affected by alterations of the immune system as drug abusers, haemophiliacs and homosexuals. Secondary immunological abnormalities are consistently pronounced in people seropositive for the virus and affected by a progressive generalized lymphoadenopathy (PGL). The degeneration of primary lymphatic organs causes a reduction of the T-cell response against any antigenic challenge. After the PGL phase the disease shifts on AIDS, that is an irreversible stadium accompanied by the deterioration of the clinical status and by an increase of immunosuppression that favours the arise of tumours. In addiction HIV infection may cause severe central nervous system (CNS) dysfunctions, the HIV associated neurological syndromes include myelopathy, meningitis, encephalitis and peripheral neuropathy.

During this period, computer tomography, determination of serum AFP/HCG, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy represented the modern diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Before orchiectomy 67% of the patients had elevated AFP/HCG. An abnormal postorchiectomy serum tumour marker decrease and the presence of small vessel infiltration in the histological sections of the primary tumour significantly predicted microscopic retroperitoneal metastases in patients with clinical stage I (CSI) nonseminoma. One-third of these patients had a pathological stage II (PSII). After radiotherapy 99% of 90 seminoma patients (CSI/IIa) survived for 5 years. After cisplatin-based chemotherapy (+radiotherapy/surgery) the 5-year survival rate in 25 patients with advanced seminoma was 81%. The survival rate in 148 nonseminoma patients PSI/IIa was 100% and 87% in 94 patients with advanced nonseminoma (greater than or equal to CSIIb). Nausea, general exhaustion, myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, and Raynaud-like phenomena were the main acute treatment-related side effects. Slight gastrointestinal problems, slight peripheral neuropathy, Raynaud-like phenomena, and fertility disturbances were frequent late side effects.

In 15 patients with spinal injuries, although the aetiology was predominantly neurological, six exhibited poor flow in the deep penile arteries following injection of papaverine. This was associated with poor erections in these patients, suggesting a vascular pathology. In 27 patients with diabetes the results showed a mixed pattern. Vascular disease was almost universal, combined with varying degrees of autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, and only three had full erections with papaverine. Those with pelvic trauma (8 patients) also had a mixed picture, although some had good erections following papaverine injection. Duplex Doppler scanning of the deep penile arteries correlated with the quality of papaverine-induced erection.
