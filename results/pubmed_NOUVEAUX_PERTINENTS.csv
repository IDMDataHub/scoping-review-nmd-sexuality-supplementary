39325119,"Methotrexate: Use in the Post Dobbs v. Jackson Era.","Huddleston EM; Saag KG","Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases",2024,"Methotrexate is one of the most frequently used medications for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Although initially developed for use as chemotherapy for both solid and hematologic malignancies, it was used as early as the 1960s with success for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis, ultimately being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of RA in 1988. Beyond RA and psoriatic arthritis, methotrexate is used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and other inflammatory conditions. Methotrexate is cytotoxic to the trophoblast and has been used to treat both ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, leading to studies in the early 1990s that showed it was effective and safe for early abortion in combination with prostaglandin E1 analog misoprostol. Methotrexate is also a teratogen, causing serious birth defects in 6%-10% of patients taking it while pregnant. Additionally, women are more likely to be affected by both RA at SLE, as compared with males, thus worsening the burden of these adverse effects. Both methotrexate's history of use as an abortifacient and its teratogenic properties make its use more complicated in the current era of abortion policy in the United States following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling. Recently published data suggest that this ruling has affected both provider perspectives and patient experiences as it relates to methotrexate use. In the post-Dobbs era, the role of the rheumatologist as it relates to patients' sexual and reproductive health is likely to expand.","10.1097/RHU.0000000000002130","Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Abortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidal; Abortion, Induced; Antirheumatic Agents; History, 20th Century; Methotrexate; Rheumatic Diseases; United States","","Journal Article; Review"
38021525,"A Rare Case of Penoscrotal Webbing and Extensive Hernias: An Anatomical Report With Genetic Insights.","Olson CM; Frolov A; Tan Y; Martin JR; Campbell M","Cureus",2023,"During a routine anatomical dissection of an 81-year-old male cadaver received through the Gift Body Program of Saint Louis University School of Medicine (SLU SOM), a massive bulging in the abdominal area was observed that was consistent with numerous hernia repairs noted in the donor's self-reported medical history. Gross anatomical dissection of the cadaveric body revealed extensive herniation of portions of the small intestine and peritoneal sac along the costal margin and extending to the left aspect of the abdomen. Additionally, an uncircumcised phallus was buried within the suprapubic fat pad and demonstrated simple, grade III penoscrotal webbing (PSW), creating an impression of micropenis presence. To gain additional insights into the current case, analysis of the coding regions (exomes) of DNA procured from the body for putative genetic variants was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. This analysis revealed 110 rare (minor allele frequency (MAF) ≤ 0.01), pathologic/deleterious genetic mutations. The most relevant variants to this case were the ones associated with male sexual development, BMP1 and BMP4; connective tissue development, COL3A1 and COL5A3; cilia morphogenesis and function, DNAH5 and MAPK15; as well as hormonal homeostasis, ESR1. Direct involvement of BMP1 both in male sexual development and hernia genesis makes it a strong candidate for linking the two pathologies, PSW and multiple hernias, observed in the present case. Yet the presence of a group of mutated genes linked to myopathies (ITGA7, NRAP, POLM, SCN5A, XIRP2) and muscular dystrophy (ITGA7) raises a question about the involvement of these muscular pathologies in hernia genesis and unsuccessful hernia repairs associated with the current case.","10.7759/cureus.47375","","anatomical variation; genetic screen; hernias; muscular pathologies; penoscrotal webbing; wound healing","Case Reports; Journal Article"

However, no specific treatment has been proposed to date. To our knowledge, this is the first (pilot) study aiming to investigate the effect of an 8-week tailored physiotherapy program on the sexual health of women with SSc and IIM. METHODS: In total, 12 women with SSc and 4 women with IIM were enrolled in the study. Based on the patients' capability to participate in the program, they were divided into an intervention group (IG) (mean ± SD age 46.8 ± 8.6 years) and a control group (CG) (mean ± SD age 46.3 ± 8.5 years). IG underwent the 8-week program (1 h of supervised physiotherapy twice weekly), whereas CG received no physiotherapy. At weeks 0 and 8, all patients filled in questionnaires assessing sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI], Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women [BISF-W]), sexual quality of life (Sexual Quality of Life-Female [SQoL-F]), functional ability (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]), quality of life (Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 [SF-36]), and depression (Beck's Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]). The changes were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Friedmann's test. RESULTS: Compared to the statistically significant deterioration in CG over weeks 0-8, we found statistically significant improvements in the total scores of FSFI and BISF-W, and some of their domains, functional status, and the physical component of quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our 8-week physiotherapy program not only prevented the natural course of progressive deterioration of functional ability but also led to a significant improvement in sexual function and quality of life in women with SSc and IIM. However, due to the lack of randomization and a relatively small sample size resulting from the strict inclusion criteria, further validation of our results is needed.

34251644,"Role of L-Arginine in Nitric Oxide Synthesis and Health in Humans.","Wu G; Meininger CJ; McNeal CJ; Bazer FW; Rhoads JM","Advances in experimental medicine and biology",2021,"As a functional amino acid (AA), L-arginine (Arg) serves not only as a building block of protein but also as an essential substrate for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), creatine, polyamines, homoarginine, and agmatine in mammals (including humans). NO (a major vasodilator) increases blood flow to tissues. Arg and its metabolites play important roles in metabolism and physiology. Arg is required to maintain the urea cycle in the active state to detoxify ammonia. This AA also activates cellular mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) and focal adhesion kinase cell signaling pathways in mammals, thereby stimulating protein synthesis, inhibiting autophagy and proteolysis, enhancing cell migration and wound healing, promoting spermatogenesis and sperm quality, improving conceptus survival and growth, and augmenting the production of milk proteins. Although Arg is formed de novo from glutamine/glutamate and proline in humans, these synthetic pathways do not provide sufficient Arg in infants or adults. Thus, humans and other animals do have dietary needs of Arg for optimal growth, development, lactation, and fertility. Much evidence shows that oral administration of Arg within the physiological range can confer health benefits to both men and women by increasing NO synthesis and thus blood flow in tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle and the corpora cavernosa of the penis). NO is a vasodilator, a neurotransmitter, a regulator of nutrient metabolism, and a killer of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses [including coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19). Thus, Arg supplementation can enhance immunity, anti-infectious, and anti-oxidative responses, fertility, wound healing, ammonia detoxification, nutrient digestion and absorption, lean tissue mass, and brown adipose tissue development; ameliorate metabolic syndromes (including dyslipidemia, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension); and treat individuals with erectile dysfunction, sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and pre-eclampsia.","10.1007/978-3-030-74180-8_10","Animals; Arginine; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Nitric Oxide; Pregnancy; Protein Biosynthesis; SARS-CoV-2","Arginine; Blood flow; Disease; Health; Metabolism; Nitric oxide; Skeletal muscle","Journal Article"

Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are vasodilating drugs established in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and pulmonary hypertension. We reviewed published data on the effects of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors on CBF in adult humans. A systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Embase, Medline and Cochrane Library Trials databases were searched. Sixteen studies with 353 participants in total were retrieved. Studies included healthy volunteers and patients with migraine, ED, type 2 diabetes, stroke, pulmonary hypertension, Becker muscular dystrophy and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Most studies used middle cerebral artery flow velocity to estimate CBF. Few studies employed direct measurements of tissue perfusion. Resting CBF velocity was unaffected by phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, but cerebrovascular regulation was improved in ED, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, Becker's and a group of healthy volunteers. This evidence suggests that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors improve responsiveness of the cerebral vasculature, particularly in disease states associated with an impaired endothelial dilatory response. This supports the potential therapeutic use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors in vascular cognitive impairment where CBF is reduced. Further studies with better resolution of deep CBF are warranted.

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the sexual function and the quality of sleep of caregiving mothers of sons with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). METHODS: We evaluated 20 caregiving mothers of sons with DMD and 20 caregiving mothers of sons without any neuromuscular or chronic disease. All of them voluntarily responded to the evaluating questionnaires about their sexuality and their quality of sleep, and gave blood samples to evaluate their hormonal levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All mothers were evaluated using the questionnaire of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Pittsburgh questionnaire (PSQI). The blood samples were tested to determine serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, progesterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol. RESULTS: Caregiving mothers of sons with DMD had significantly lower scores in the FSFI questionnaire, suggesting a higher risk for sexual dysfunction. The PSQI demonstrated that these caregiving mothers present increased sleep latency, reduced sleep efficiency, daytime dysfunction, and poor sleep quality. Blood tests showed a rise in cortisol levels, which correlated with the compromised sexuality and quality of sleep. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that caregiving mothers of sons with DMD show major risk for sexual dysfunction and a reduction in their quality of sleep mediated in part by the hormonal changes related to stress.

The characterization of its downstream signalling, mediated through stimulation of soluble GC (sGC) and cGMP generation, initiated significant translational interest, but until recently this was almost exclusively embodied by the use of PDE5 inhibitors in erectile dysfunction. Since then, research progress in two areas has contributed to an impressive expansion of the therapeutic targeting of the NO-sGC-cGMP axis: first, an increased understanding of the molecular events operating within this complex pathway and second, a better insight into its dys-regulation and uncoupling in human disease. Already-approved PDE5 inhibitors and novel, first-in-class molecules, which up-regulate the activity of sGC independently of NO and/or of the enzyme's haem prosthetic group, are undergoing clinical evaluation to treat pulmonary hypertension and myocardial failure. These molecules, as well as combinations or second-generation compounds, are also being assessed in additional experimental disease models and in patients in a wide spectrum of novel indications, such as endotoxic shock, diabetic cardiomyopathy and Becker's muscular dystrophy. There is well-founded optimism that the modulation of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway will sustain the development of an increasing number of successful clinical candidates for years to come.","10.1111/bph.12980","Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular System; Cyclic GMP; Drug Design; Guanylate Cyclase; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Nitric Oxide; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Signal Transduction; Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"
24607254,"Dog as a model in studies on human hereditary diseases and their gene therapy.","Switonski M","Reproductive biology",2014,"During the last 15 years spectacular progress has been achieved in knowledge on the dog genome organization and the molecular background of hereditary diseases in this species. A majority of canine genetic diseases have their counterparts in humans and thus dogs are considered as a very important large animal model in human biomedicine. Among canine monogenic diseases with known causative gene mutations there are two large groups classified as retinal dystrophies and lysosomal storage diseases. Specific types of these diseases are usually diagnosed in a single or several breeds. A well known disorder, restricted to a single breed, is congenital stationary night blindness described in Briards. This disease is a counterpart of Leber amaurosis in children. On the other hand, one of the most common monogenic human diseases (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), has its canine counterparts in several breeds (e.g., the Golden retriever, Beagle and German short-haired pointer). For some of the canine diseases gene therapy strategy was successfully applied, e.g., for congenital stationary night blindness, rod-cone dystrophy and muccopolysaccharydoses type I, IIIB and VII. Since phenotypic variability between the breeds is exceptionally high, the dog is an interesting model to study the molecular background of congenital malformations (e.g., dwarfism and osteoporosis imperfecta). Also disorders of sexual development (DSD), especially testicular or ovotesticular DSD (78,XX; SRY-negative), which is widely distributed across dozens of breeds, are of particular interest. Studies on the genetic background of canine cancers, a major health problem in this species, are also quite advanced. On the other hand, genetic studies on canine counterparts of major human complex diseases (e.g., obesity, the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus) are still in their infancy.","10.1016/j.repbio.2013.12.007","Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Dogs; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Genetic Therapy; Genome","Congenital malformation; Disorder of sexual development; Gene therapy; Lysosomal storage disease; Obesity; Retinal dystrophy","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

18590822,"Actin associated proteins function as androgen receptor coregulators: an implication of androgen receptor's roles in skeletal muscle.","Ting HJ; Chang C","The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology",2008,"This review of androgen receptor (AR) coregulators, which also function as actin-binding proteins, intends to establish the connection between actin cytoskeletal components and androgen signaling, especially in skeletal muscle. In cellular and animal models, androgen activated AR modulates myoblasts proliferation, promotes sexual dimorphic muscle development, and alters muscle fiber type. In the clinical setting, administration of anabolic androgens can decrease cachexia and speed wound healing. During myogenesis and regeneration of skeletal muscle in embryo and adult, the membrane of myoblasts fuse and the actin cytoskeleton is rearranged to form an alignment with myosin to form myotubes then ultimately the myofibrils. Contraction of skeletal muscle promotes the growth of myocytes by coordinating signals from the neuromuscular junction to intra-myofibrils through costameres, the functional structure comprised of signal proteins closely associated with actin filaments and involved in muscular dystrophy. Therefore, the discovery of actin-binding proteins functioning as AR coregulators implies that androgen signaling is tightly regulated during the process of the development and regeneration of skeletal muscle. The search for selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM) that act precisely in skeletal muscle instead of other tissues could target the engineering of a SARM-AR complex that selectively recruits these coregulators.","10.1016/j.jsbmb.2008.06.001","Actins; Androgens; Humans; Microfilament Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Receptors, Androgen; Signal Transduction","","Journal Article; Review"
18257791,"An exploratory study of parents' approaches to health promotion in families of adolescents with physical disabilities.","Antle BJ; Mills W; Steele C; Kalnins I; Rossen B","Child: care, health and development",2008,"BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of children with physical disabilities now extends into adulthood and has been accompanied by the transfer of rehabilitation services from institutions to the home. Thus, families must increasingly partner with health service providers to promote their child's health and prevent the development of secondary conditions that may contribute to heart disease, stroke, respiratory diseases, low endurance and emotional difficulties. AIM: To investigate within a family context the health promotion efforts of parents on behalf of a child with a physical disability. METHOD: The Long Interview Method was used to interview 15 families (11 two-parent and 4 single-parent) having a child 11-16 years of age with a physical disability including cerebral palsy (7), spina bifida (3), muscular dystrophy (3) and other conditions (2). RESULTS: Parents' health promotion efforts were characterized by three main themes. First, parents emphasized traditional lifestyle health behaviours including nutrition, physical activity, tobacco, alcohol and drug use, and personal hygiene. Second, parents tried to foster their adolescent's social life and friendships. They expressed particular concern about how, and if, their child would develop a sense of purpose and have a productive future. Third, parents invested a great deal of effort into observing daily routines, making arrangements for their child's social inclusion and supporting their child in a way that balanced independence with safety and energy conservation. CONCLUSIONS: Parents recognize that their child with a physical disability faces greater obstacles, and work hard at health promotion. Healthcare workers need to work with parents to: (1) provide information about specific lifestyle health behaviours including nutrition, physical activity and sexuality; (2) advocate for resources to foster social inclusion; and (3) discuss family strategies that balance parental involvement with their child's need for independence and energy conservation for daily activities.","10.1111/j.1365-2214.2007.00782.x","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Children with Disabilities; Family; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Promotion; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Life Style; Male; Parent-Child Relations; Parenting; Parents; Surveys and Questionnaires","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Molecular analysis reported here reveals that the predicted tra-3 gene product is a member of the calpain family of calcium-regulated cytosolic proteases, though it lacks the calcium binding regulatory domain. Calpains are regulatory processing proteases, exhibiting marked substrate specificity, and mutations in the p94 isoform underlie the human hereditary condition limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A.

DESIGN: Case-comparison study using written survey. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: The questionnaire was mailed to 1,150 women with physical disabilities who were recruited as volunteers or through independent living centers. Each woman gave a second copy of the questionnaire to an able-bodied female friend, which comprised the comparison group. The response rate was 45%, with 475 cases and 425 comparisons eligible to participate. The most common disability type was spinal cord injury (24%), followed by polio (18%), muscular dystrophy (11%), cerebral palsy (11%), multiple sclerosis (10%), joint disorders (7%), and skeletal abnormalities (5%). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sexual-functioning, consisting of four factors: (1) sexual desire, (2) sexual activity, (3) sexual response, (4) sexual satisfaction. RESULTS: Highly significant differences were found in level of sexual activity (p = .000001), response (p = .000009), and satisfaction (p=.000001) between women with and without disabilities.

The studied ARRDs were spondyloarthritis (n = 9), systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 6), Behcet disease (BD, n = 5), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 5), antiphospholipid syndrome (n = 1), and dermatomyositis (n = 1). The most reported effects of ARRDs on fertility are i) high levels of reproductive hormones, mainly in RA and SLE; ii) impaired semen quality in SLE, spondyloarthritis, and BD; and iii) higher rate of varicocele in BD and spondyloarthritis. Regarding the treatments effects, i) conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (e.g.; methotrexate and salazopyrine) increase testosterone level, ii) cyclophosphamide impairs fertility, iii) anti-tumor necrosis factor agents are associated with improvement in semen quality, and iv) no increased number of miscarriages or congenital abnormalities in children fathered by BD was reported. To conclude, both ARRDs and their treatments alter fertility in males with ARRDs. In practice, in addition to the conventional semen analysis, screening for infertility seems legitimate in males with ARRDs.","10.1016/j.jri.2021.103472","Autoimmune Diseases; Child; Female; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Pregnancy; Reproductive Health; Rheumatic Diseases; Semen Analysis; Spondylarthritis","Antiphospholipid syndrome; Behcet syndrome; Dermatomyositis; Fertility; Rheumatic diseases; Sexual health; Spondylarthropathies rheumatoid arthritis; Systemic lupus erythematosus","Journal Article; Systematic Review"

Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are characterized by impaired muscle function with a majority of patients developing sustained disability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient's individual priorities (patient preference) of disabilities most important to improve in PM/DM using the MacMaster Toronto Arthritis Patient Preference Disability Questionnaire (MACTAR), to correlate the MACTAR to myositis outcomes and to evaluate its test-retest reliability. Methods. Twenty-eight patients with PM/DM performed recommended outcomes as well as the MACTAR, which was performed twice with one week apart. Results. Sexual activity, walking, biking, social activities, and sleep constituted the predominating disabilities. Seventy-two and 33% of the identified disabilities were not covered by items of the Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Myositis Activities Profile. Correlations between the MACTAR and health-related quality of life measures were r(s) = -0.67-0.73, correlations with measures of activities of daily living and participation in society were r(s) = 0.51-0.60 with lower correlations for other outcomes. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and weighted Kappa (K(w)) coefficients were 0.83 and 0.68, respectively, for test-retest reliability of the MACTAR. Conclusions. The MACTAR interview had promising measurement properties and identified patient preference disabilities in PM/DM that were not covered by recommended outcomes.","10.5402/2011/463124","","","Journal Article"

Auto-immune diseases develop in individuals with a genetic pre-disposition. Among the endogenous factors, also sexual hormones play a role, especially prolactin. The objective of the study was to use basal exam and TRH test to determine stimulated prolactin values in patients with a systemic connective tissue disease: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome, dermatomyositis. PATIENT GROUP AND METHODS: The authors examined 43 patients with systemic connective tissue diseases: 20 patients with SLE, 7 patients with Sjögren's syndrome, 7 patients with systemic sclerosis and 9 patients with dermatomyositis. The mean age of the patients was 39.87 years. The control group consisted of 30 volunteers with a mean age of 35.17 years. OUTCOME: Prolactin level in the patients with systemic connective tissue diseases was 14.629 ng/ml, which is more than in the control group. A statistically significant increase in prolactin level was recorded 20 minutes after i.v. stimulation as compared with the control group (30.982 ng/ml). This statistically significant difference was still present 60 minutes after the TRH administration, with 16.43 ng/ml in the control group, and 36.890 ng/ml in the systemic connective tissue disorder patient group. The differences between prolactin levels for the different systemic connective tissue diseases were not statistically significant. A positive correlation in the patient group was found between the stimulated prolactin values and the FW value. On the whole, however, there was no clear correlation found between laboratory activity and prolactin levels. CONCLUSION: The authors found out that post-stimulation prolactin levels were statistically significantly higher in patients with systemic connective tissue disease as compared with the control group. Correlation analyses did not show a clear link between inflammatory activity and prolactin levels, and therefore the authors assume that medium increased values of prolactin are rather a risk factor for the disease than an inflammation marker in patients with a systemic connective tissue disease.",NA,"Adult; Autoimmune Diseases; Connective Tissue Diseases; Female; Humans; Male; Prolactin; Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone","","English Abstract; Journal Article"

When the risk of developing autoimmune diseases such as uveitis, polymyositis, and arthritis is included, one can estimate the life-long risk of infected individuals to develop an HTLV associated pathology as approximately 10%. The populations at risk are, in a large majority, from developing countries but the epidemic of HTLV-II infection in intravenous drug users (IVDU) represents a possible reservoir for dissemination in the general population. The number of HTLV-I-infected individuals (15 to 25 million), together with the severity of associated disease, justifies the development of a vaccine. Different vaccine preparations have been developed, using mostly recombinant pox and adenoviruses, but DNA plasmid technology will soon become a feasible approach. Various animal models exist for experimental viral infections, involving rats, rabbits, or monkeys, but up to now, neither hematological nor neurological disorders have been induced by HTLV infection in such animal models. For long-term protection from HTLV-I-associated diseases, vaccination should induce both neutralizing antibodies and specific cell-mediated immunity. This will require the incorporation of both env and gag coding sequences in the vaccine preparations. Preventive clinical trials may involve different cohorts of seronegative young girls from endemic areas prior to sexual activity and IVDU in the industrialized world. In parallel, one should consider therapeutic vaccine trials in HTLV-I-positive mothers and IVDU to protect them against disease development. The observed rate of seroconversion in these different cohorts makes such trials feasible.","10.1097/00042560-199600001-00029","Animals; Antibody Formation; Cancer Vaccines; Clinical Trials as Topic; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Products, gag; Haplorhini; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; Human T-lymphotropic virus 2; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Leukemia, T-Cell; Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic; Rabbits; Rats; Recombination, Genetic; Vaccination; Viral Envelope Proteins","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

Calculation of ovulation-years appears to be a potentially useful and practical method for identification of the high-risk individual. Risk factors for nonepithelial ovarian cancer are largely unknown, and consequently clinical diagnosis is stressed in the early detection of these tumors. Patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome or ovarian dysgenesis are significantly at risk and require at least regular pelvic examination. Of course, individuals with sexual precocity are at high risk for sex cord/stromal or germ cell malignancies. Individuals with a family history of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors and benign thyroid disease also deserve close observation. Early clinical detection requires a sensitivity to presenting symptomatology (e.g., diffuse abdominopelvic complaints) as well as the skill and knowledge needed to recognize and appropriately manage adnexal masses. Harbingers of ovarian malignancy in the elderly woman, including unexplained hypercalcemia, new onset dermatomyositis, and cerebellar degeneration, should motivate thorough gynecologic evaluation. While radionuclide ovarian imaging for detection of early epithelial cancers of the ovary may become more generally available in the future, ultrasound imaging of the postmenopausal ovary, and peritoneal cytology may be of immediate value in screening high-risk women.",NA,"Age Factors; Female; Humans; Ovarian Neoplasms; Ovary; Parity; Pregnancy; Risk; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Ultrasonography; Vaginal Smears","","Journal Article; Review"
39451238,"The Emerging Role of Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibition in Neurological Disorders: The State of the Art.","Crescioli C; Paronetto MP","Cells",2024,"Growing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is not just a consequence of neurodegeneration in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but it is rather a determinant factor, which plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of these disorders. Neuroinflammation can affect cells and processes in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as immune cells, and might precede protein aggregation, which is a hallmark of the neurodegenerative process. Standard treatment methods are far from being able to counteract inflammation and delay neurodegeneration. Remarkably, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5is), which represent potent vasoactive drugs used as a first-line treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED), display important anti-inflammatory effects through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level stabilization. Since PDE5 hydrolyzes cGMP, several studies positioned PDE5 as a therapeutic target, and more specifically, PDE5is as potential alternative strategies for the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders. Indeed, PDE5is can limit neuroinflammation and enhance synaptic plasticity, with beneficial effects on cognitive function and memory. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of some of the main processes underlying neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration which may be potential targets for PDE5is, focusing on sildenafil, the most extensively studied.

Despite this relationship between BDNF and ND, only a few ND animal models have been able to recapitulate the low BDNF state, thereby hindering research into the therapeutic targeting of this important neurotrophic factor. In order to address this unmet need, we sought to develop a reproducible model of BDNF reduction by inducing traumatic brain injury (TBI) using a closed head momentum exchange injury model in mature 9-month-old male and female rats. Head impacts were repetitive and varied in intensity from mild to severe. BDNF levels, as assessed by ELISA, were significantly reduced in the hippocampus of both males and females as well as in the substantia nigra of males 12 days after mild TBI. However, we observed significant sexual dimorphism in multiple sequelae, including magnetic resonance imaging-determined vasogenic edema, astrogliosis (GFAP-activation), and microgliosis (Iba1 activation).

Cordyceps has been used in traditional medicine due to its immense health benefits, as it boosts stamina, appetite, immunity, longevity, libido, memory, and sleep. Neuronal loss is the typical feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) and neurotrauma. Both these conditions share common pathophysiological features, like oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and glutamatergic excitotoxicity. Cordyceps bioactives (adenosine, N6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-adenosine, ergosta-7, 9 (11), 22-trien-3β-ol, active peptides, and polysaccharides) exert potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities and display beneficial effects in the management and/or treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in vitro and in vivo. Although a considerable list of compounds is available from Cordyceps, only a few have been evaluated for their neuroprotective potential and still lack information for clinical trials.

Non-motor symptoms explored in this population-based study include pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal issues, poor sleep, low mood, anxiety, problematic saliva, apathy, emotional lability, cognitive complaints and sexual dysfunction. People registered on the Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation of motor neuron disease platform, the Scottish Motor Neuron Disease Register, were invited to complete a questionnaire on non-motor symptoms and a self-reported Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale. The questionnaire comprised a pre-defined list of 11 potential non-motor symptoms, with the opportunity to list additional symptoms. A total of 120 individuals participated in this cross-sectional study, a 39% response rate of those sent questionnaires (n = 311); 99% of participants recruited (n = 120) experienced at least one non-motor symptom, with 72% (n = 120) reporting five or more. The symptoms most often reported were pain and fatigue (reported by 76% of participants, respectively).

For most of her life, she relied on extreme idealization of important people in her life as her primary defense mechanism, helping her to maintain physical and psychological survival. However, after a KAP session in January 2023 she discovered the consequences of her extreme idealizing tendencies. Among these was the creation of troubling double binds for the people she idealized, as well as the fomentation of conflict between these individuals with each other. Also unconscious was the secondary gain offered by her escalating physical symptoms and pain-that is, the ability to resolve conflicts between those she idealized-and how this secondary gain increased the likelihood of symptom exacerbations during periods of conflict. After the discovery of these unconscious tendencies during her KAP session, the patient has since been able to avoid extreme idealization of important people in her life and has subsequently experienced fewer episodes of exacerbation of her physical symptoms.

Recent findings indicate that the pathological acetylation state of NF-κB/RelA and histone 3 (H3) occurring in the SOD1(G93A) murine model of ALS can be corrected by the synergistic combination of low doses of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-sirtuin 1 pathway activator resveratrol and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors MS-275 (entinostat) or valproate.

RECENT FINDINGS: Sex is a crucial factor in the response to toxicants, yet the sex-specific effects of OP exposure, particularly in juveniles and adults, remain unresolved. This is largely due to study design and inconsistencies in exposure and outcome assessments. Exposure to OPs results in multiple adverse outcomes influenced by many factors including sex. Reported sex-specific effects suggest that males are more susceptible to OPs, which reflects the sex-dependent prevalence of various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in which males are at greater risk. Thus, this review proposes that the biological sex-specific effects elicited by OP exposure may in part underlie the dimorphic susceptibilities observed in neurological disorders. Understanding the immediate and long-term effects of OP exposure across sexes will be critical in advancing our understanding of OP-induced neurotoxicity and disease.","10.1007/s40572-017-0171-y","Environmental Exposure; Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Occupational Exposure; Organophosphates; Pesticides; Sex Characteristics","Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurodevelopment; Organophosphate; Pesticides; Sex; Sexual dimorphism","Journal Article; Review; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Alterations in AR function are central to reproductive disorders, prostate cancer, and Kennedy disease. AR activity is influenced by post-translational modifications, but their role in AR-based diseases is poorly understood. Conjugation by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins at two synergy control (SC) motifs in AR exerts a promoter context-dependent inhibitory role. SC motifs are composed of a four-amino acid core that is often preceded and/or followed by nearby proline or glycine residues. The function of these flanking residues, however, has not been examined directly. Remarkably, several AR mutations associated with oligospermia and androgen insensitivity syndrome map to Pro-390, the conserved proline downstream of the first SC motif in AR. Similarly, mutations at Gly-524, downstream of the second SC motif, were recovered in recurrent prostate cancer samples. We now provide evidence that these clinically isolated substitutions lead to a partial loss of SC motif function and AR SUMOylation that affects multiple endogenous genes. Consistent with a structural role as terminators of secondary structure elements, substitution of Pro-390 by Gly fully supports both SC motif function and SUMOylation. As predicted from the functional properties of SC motifs, the clinically isolated mutations preferentially enhance transcription driven by genomic regions harboring multiple AR binding sites. The data support the view that alterations in AR SUMOylation play significant roles in AR-based diseases and offer novel SUMO-based therapeutic opportunities.","10.1074/jbc.M112.395210","Amino Acid Motifs; Androgen-Insensitivity Syndrome; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Prostatic Neoplasms; Receptors, Androgen; Sumoylation","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

The first is that KSHV is distributed disparately throughout the world, with the virus being common in the general population throughout Africa and the Middle East, but uncommon virtually everywhere else. The second is that even though the virus is uncommon in the general population in industrialized settings, it is disproportionately concentrated among homosexual men in these areas.

Improvement of quality of life at old age and prevention of age-associated diseases have become the main focus of the aging research. The process of aging in humans is complex and underlies multiple influences, with the probable involvement of heritable and various environmental factors. In particular, hormones are decisively involved in the generation of aging. Over time, important circulating hormones decline due to a reduced secretion of the pituitary, the adrenal glands and the gonads or due to an intercurrent disease. Among them, serum levels of growth factors and sexual steroids show significant aging-associated changes. Within the scope of the Explorative Project 'Genetic aetiology of human longevity' supported by the German National Genome Research Network 2 (NGFN-2) an in vitro model of human hormonal aging has been developed. Human SZ95 sebocytes were maintained under a hormone-substituted environment consisting of growth factors and sexual steroids in concentrations corresponding to those circulating in 20- and in 60-year-old women. Eight hundred and ninety-nine genes showed a differential expression in SZ95 sebocytes maintained under the 20- and 60-year-old hormone mixture, respectively. Among them genes were regulated which are involved in biological processes which are all hallmarks of aging. The most significantly altered signaling pathway identified was that of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). A disturbed function of this cascade has been associated with tumorigenesis, i.e. in pancreatic, prostate, intestine, breast, and uterine cancer. Interestingly, genes expressed in signaling pathways operative in age-associated diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were also identified. These data demonstrate that skin and its appendages may represent an adequate model for aging research. Hormones interact in a complex fashion, and aging may be partly attributed to the changes in their circulating blood levels. Furthermore, a disturbed hormone status may partially act towards the manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, these results could be a basis for an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of the aging process.","10.1016/j.exger.2007.07.002","Aging; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome, Human; Hormones; Humans; Models, Biological; Sebaceous Glands; Skin Aging","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

However, the role played by this reaction is not fully understood. The present findings suggest that neuroinflammtory mediators such as cytokines may be involved in a number of key steps in the pathological cascade of events leading to neuronal injury. This hypothesis is strongly supported by experimental and clinical observations indicating that inhibition of the inflammatory reaction correlates with less neuronal damage. Estrogens are thought to play a role in the sex difference observed in many neurological diseases with inflammatory components including stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Clinical and experimental studies have established estrogen as a neuroprotective hormone in these diseases. However, the exact mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of estrogens are still unclear. It is possible that the beneficial effects of these hormones may be dependent on their inhibitory activity on the inflammatory reaction associated with the above-mentioned brain pathologies. Here, we review the current clinical and experimental evidence with respect to the inflammation-modulating effects of estrogens as one potential explanatory factor for sexual dimorzphism in the prevalence of numerous neurological diseases.","10.1385/ENDO:29:2:243","Animals; Atherosclerosis; Cytokines; Estrogens; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Prognosis; Sex Characteristics; Stroke","","Journal Article; Review"

These include head injury, multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Accumulating evidence suggests that observed differences between men and women could result from estrogen's wide range of effects within the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), with it's neuroprotective effect being one of the most important. It seems possible that neuroprotective activity of estrogen could be partially a result of it's anti-inflammatory action. It has been well established that inflammation plays an important role in the etiopathogenesis and manifestation of brain pathological changes. In this regard, an important role has been suggested for pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by activated glial cells, neurons and immune cells that invade brain tissue. Within the CNS, cytokines stimulate inflammatory processes that may impair blood-brain barrier permeability as well as promote apoptosis of neurons, oligodendrocytes and induce myelin damage. Given that estrogen may modulate cytokine expression, coupled with the fact that gender differences of cytokine production are apparent in animal models of PD and MS, suggests an important connection between hormonal-cytokine link in neurodegeneration. Indeed, while MS patients and mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) display gender specific alterations of IFN-gamma and IL-12, variations of TNF and IL-6 were associated with PD. Also in case of more acute neurodegenerative conditions, such as stroke, the effect of IL-6 gene G-174C polymorphism was different in males and females. Given that our understanding of the role of estrogen on cytokine production and accompanying CNS pathological conditions is limited, the present reviews aims to present some of our recent findings in this area and further evaluate the evidence that may be relevant to the design of new hormonal anti-inflammatory treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.","10.2174/1381612053381693","Animals; Cytokines; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Male; Nervous System Diseases; Sex Characteristics","","Journal Article; Review"

Mutations in the AR cause various degrees of androgen resistance resulting in a range of androgen insensitivity syndromes. A single copy gene in the X chromosome encodes the AR. The gene contains a polymorphic triple repeat sequence [(CAG)n] with 9-36 repeats in the normal population, and displays ethnic dependence. In vitro, there is an inverse correlation between CAG repeat length and AR function. Associations exist between short alleles and prostate cancer in men or clinical hyperandrogenism in women. Expansion of the CAG tract > 40 repeats leads to spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy disease), an adult onset neurodegenerative disease that also presents with low virilization and spermatogenetic defects. The disease may show evidence of anticipation (increasing severity with succeeding generations accompanying further expansion of repeat length). Twelve studies involving Singaporean, Australian, North American and Japanese men reported a relationship between AR CAG repeat length and male infertility, whereas 10 studies, most of them European, found no association. Differences in hereditary or acquired factors in these populations may explain the equivocality. However, statistical methods, sample sizes, study definition and control populations, in addition to laboratory methods vary widely within the published papers, and could affect the results and conclusions. Current data is insufficient to conclude whether IVF patients who display AR CAG expansion may transfer infertility or premutation of neurodegenerative disease to their descendants.

In addition, we estimate parameters using weekly incidence data from previous ZIKV outbreaks in Colombia and Puerto Rico to capture the dynamics of an epidemic in each country when control measures are available. The basic reproduction number, R0, of each country is calculated using estimated parameters (without the controls). The vector-borne transmission threshold (Rv) is dominant in both countries , but the sexual transmission threshold (Rd) in Colombia is considerably higher than in Puerto Rico.

The virus was initially identified in a rhesus monkey in Uganda in 1947 and later in a human in Nigeria in 1952. Since 2007, the prevalence of the virus has been on the rise, culminating in a major outbreak in the United States (US) in 2015. During this outbreak, the adult population was severely impacted, experiencing a range of symptoms, including organ failure, microcephaly, fetal death, and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Additionally, skin rash, limb swelling, fever, headache, and heightened sensitivity are found in most adults with Zika syndrome. Although the virus can be transmitted through blood, vertical transmission from mother to child, and sexual contact, the primary way of transmission of the virus is through the Aedes mosquito. Cells such as neurons, macrophages, peripheral dendritic cells, and placental cells are among the target cells that the virus can infect. The TAM AXL receptor plays a crucial role in infection. After the virus enters the body through the bloodstream, it spreads in the body with a latent period of 3 to 12 days. Currently, there is no specific treatment or publicly available vaccine for the ZIKV. Limited laboratory testing has been conducted, and existing drugs originally designed for other pathogens have been repurposed for treatment. Given the Aedes mosquito's role as a vector and the wide geographical impact of the virus, this study aims to comprehensively investigate Zika's pathogenesis and clinical symptoms based on existing knowledge and research.

Given its pivotal role in viral assembly and maturation, the NS2B-NS3 viral protease emerges as a promising therapeutic target against ZIKV. In this context, a dipeptide inhibitor was specifically chosen as a control against 200 compounds for docking analysis. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations extending over 200 ns were conducted to ascertain the stability of the docked complex and confirm the binding of the inhibitor at the protein's active site. The simulation outcomes exhibited conformity to acceptable thresholds, encompassing parameters such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), ligand-protein interaction analysis, ligand characterization, and surface area analysis. Notably, analysis of ligand angles bolstered the identification of prospective ligands capable of inhibiting viral protein activity and impeding virus dissemination.

For this study, 2-month-old male BALB/c mice were infected with 1.26 x 106 PFU/mL of ZIKV in solution via the intravenous route. After three, seven, and fourteen days post-infection (DPI), blood and testicle samples were obtained to detect ZIKV RNA. The authors observed that the infected animals had slower weight gain than the control group. Viremia occurred only at 3DPI, and the ZIKV RNA was detected in one testis sample at 7DPI. The histopathological analysis of this organ revealed intense disorganization of the seminiferous tubules' structure, inflammatory infiltrate, necrosis, hemorrhage, fluid accumulation, congestion of blood vessels, and reduced sperm count. Ultrastructural analysis showed nuclear changes in tubule cells, activation of interstitial cells, and morphological changes in spermatozoa, in addition to fragmentation and decreased electron density of the genetic material of these cells. Thus, despite causing predominantly asymptomatic infections, ZIKV can cause significant subclinical and transient damage, including to male reproductive organs.","10.1590/1984-3143-AR2023-0124","","Inbred BALB/c mice; Zika virus; testis","Journal Article"

These viruses can also be transmitted through sexual contact, vertical transmission, and possibly transfusion. Most cases are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include rash, conjunctivitis, fever, and arthralgia, which are characteristic of other arboviruses. Zika infection can lead to complications such as microcephaly, miscarriage, brain abnormalities, and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). OBJECTIVE: The aim is to determine the inhibitory potential of the algae Kappaphycus alvarezii (K. alvarezii) on ZIKV replication. METHODOLOGY: Cytotoxicity experiments were performed using Vero cells to determine the CC50, and ZIKV replication inhibition assays (ATCC® VR-1839™) were conducted to determine the EC50. The mechanism of action was also studied to assess any synergistic effect with Ribavirin. RESULTS: K. alvarezii demonstrated low toxicity with a CC50 of 423 μg/mL and a potent effect on ZIKV replication with an EC50 of 0.65 μg/mL and a Selectivity Index (SI) of 651, indicating the extract's safety. Virucidal effect assays were carried out to evaluate the possible mechanism of action, and the compound addition time was studied, showing the potential to delay the treatment of infected cells by up to 6 hours. A potential synergistic effect was observed when K. alvarezii extract was combined with suboptimal concentrations of Ribavirin, resulting in 99% inhibition of viral replication. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the significant potential of K. alvarezii extract and highlight the need for further studies to investigate its mechanism of action. We propose this extract as a potential anti-Zika compound.","10.2174/0115680266294503240513044930","Antiviral Agents; Zika Virus; Animals; Chlorocebus aethiops; Vero Cells; Seaweed; Virus Replication; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Structure-Activity Relationship; Ribavirin; Plant Extracts; Edible Seaweeds; Rhodophyta","Antiviral; Arbovirus; Rhodophyta; Seaweed; Vero cells.; Zika","Journal Article"

ZIKV can be transmitted between sexual partners and from mother to fetus. Infection is strongly associated with neurologic complications in adults, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and myelitis, and congenital ZIKV infection can result in fetal injury and congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Development of an effective vaccine is imperative to protect against ZIKV vertical transmission and CZS. Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis virus (rVSV) is a highly effective and safe vector for the delivery of foreign immunogens for vaccine purposes. Here, we evaluate an rVSV vaccine expressing the full length pre-membrane (prM) and ZIKV envelope (E) proteins (VSV-ZprME), shown to be immunogenic in murine models of ZIKV infection, for its capacity to induce immune responses in nonhuman primates. Moreover, we assess the efficacy of the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine in the protection of pigtail macaques against ZIKV infection. Administration of the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine was safe, but it did not induce robust anti-ZIKV T-cell responses, IgM or IgG antibodies, or neutralizing antibodies in most animals. Post ZIKV challenge, animals that received the rVSVΔM control vaccine lacking ZIKV antigen had higher levels of plasma viremia compared to animals that received the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine. Anti-ZIKV neutralizing Ab titers were detected in a single animal that received the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine that was associated with reduced plasma viremia. The overall suboptimal ZIKV-specific cellular and humoral responses post-immunization indicates the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine did not elicit an immune response in this pilot study. However, recall antibody response to the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine indicates it may be immunogenic and further developments to the vaccine construct could enhance its potential as a vaccine candidate in a nonhuman primate pre-clinical model.","10.3389/fviro.2023.1108420","","","Journal Article"

However, this has not stopped the virus from infecting the human population globally. In particular, the global spread of ZIKV has led to a surge in observational studies. METHODS: Regarding recently published ZIKV-related literature, we are not aware of any reviews strictly focusing on ZIKV from the perspective of observational studies. Therefore, we reviewed recently published observational studies exploring the global spread of ZIKV and its association with Congenital ZIKV Infection (CZI) and clinical manifestations in adults. Online databases including google scholar, PubMed and Elsevier were used for retrieving relevant studies. RESULTS: ZIKV cases have been reported in different parts of the world, with certain regions reporting more cases than the rest, like Brazil. ZIKV causes a wide spectrum of diseases and disorders including microcephaly, developmental disorders, and Guillain-Barre syndrome to name a few. Furthermore, CZI in neonates mainly manifests into neurological disorders and diseases, whereas ZIKV in adults' targets various organs. CONCLUSION: ZIKV poses a serious threat to human population and observational studies provide a different perspective on the damaging capabilities of ZIKV in real-life settings. Moreover, there are gaps in the literature regarding ZIKV-related-complications that future experimental studies need to address. These complications include in-utero transmission, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cross-reactivity, sexual transmission, along with its persistence in the male reproductive tract.","10.18502/jad.v16i4.12188","","Arbovirus; Congenital zika infection; Flavivirus; Zika virus","Journal Article; Review"

Symptoms are generally mild, such as fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis, but neurological complications, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, have been associated to this viral infection. During pregnancy, it can cause microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in the fetus, as well as pregnancy complications, representing a serious health threat. In this study, we show for the first time that Zika virus employs cell membrane lipid rafts as a portal of entry into Vero cells. We previously demonstrated that the antifungal drug Amphotericin B (AmphB) hampers a microbe-host cell interaction through the disruption of lipid raft architecture. Here, we found that Amphotericin B by the same mechanism of action inhibits both Zika virus cell entry and replication. These data encourage further studies on the off-label use of Amphotericin B in Zika virus infections as a new and alternate antiviral therapy.","10.3390/v14092059","Amphotericin B; Animals; Antifungal Agents; Antiviral Agents; Chlorocebus aethiops; Female; Flavivirus; Humans; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Microdomains; Pregnancy; Vero Cells; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","ampothericin B; flavivirus; lipid rafts; virus-cell interaction; zika virus","Journal Article"

It is mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, but infections are also linked to sexual transmissions. Infectious ZIKV has been isolated, and viral RNA has been detected in semen over a year after the onset of initial symptoms, but the mode of long-term persistence is not yet understood. ZIKV can proliferate in human Sertoli cells (HSerC) for several weeks in vitro, suggesting that it might be a reservoir for persistent ZIKV infection. This study determined proteomic changes in HSerC during ZIKV infections by TMT-mass spectrometry analysis. Levels of 4416 unique Sertoli cell proteins were significantly altered at 3, 5, and 7 days after ZIKV infection. The significantly altered proteins include enzymes, transcription regulators, transporters, kinases, peptidases, transmembrane receptors, cytokines, ion channels, and growth factors. Many of these proteins are involved in pathways associated with antiviral response, antigen presentation, and immune cell activation. Several immune response pathway proteins were significantly activated during infection, e.g., interferon signaling, T cell receptor signaling, IL-8 signaling, and Th1 signaling. The altered protein levels were linked to predicted activation of immune response in HSerC, which was predicted to suppress ZIKV infection. ZIKV infection also affected the levels of critical regulators of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis pathways such as phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase. Interestingly, many significantly altered proteins were associated with cardiac hypertrophy, which may induce heart failure in infected patients. In summary, our research contributes to a better understanding of ZIKV replication dynamics and infection in Sertoli cells.","10.3390/v14020377","Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cardiovascular Diseases; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Male; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteomics; RNA, Viral; Semen; Sertoli Cells; Virus Replication; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Sertoli cells; Zika virus; carbohydrate metabolism; cardiovascular disease; glycolysis; immune response; persistence in semen; sexual transmission","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Nevertheless, significant knowledge gaps regarding the outcome of a mass vaccination strategy exist and must be addressed. Zika virus circulates in flavivirus-endemic regions, an ideal Zika vaccine should avoid the potential of antibody-dependent enhancement from exposure to dengue virus. Prevention of CZS is the primary goal for immunization, and the vaccine must provide protection against intrauterine transmission for use during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age. Ideally, a vaccine should also prevent sexual transmission of the virus through mucosal protection.Expert opinion: This review describes current vaccine approaches against Zika virus with particular attention to the application of virus-like particle (VLP) technology as a strategy for solving the challenges of Zika virus immunization.","10.1080/14760584.2021.1945447","Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Technology; Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle; Viral Vaccines; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Vaccine; antibody-dependent enhancement; clinical trial; congenital zika syndrome; flavivirus; immunization; mucosal protection; virus-like particle; vlp; zika virus","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

Previous studies have primarily focused on how baseline cardiac characteristics affect mortality, but the impact of non-cardiac baseline characteristics is less defined. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed/Medline (1990-2019) to identify studies that assessed the impact of baseline ATTR-PN characteristics on survival. Outcomes were first summarized descriptively. Extracted survival data were then disaggregated, and parametric mixture models were used to assess survival differences among patient groups defined by factors known to affect survival. RESULTS: The search yielded 1193 records, of which 35 were retained for analysis. Median survival ranged from 0.5 to > 25 years. The largest survival differences were between cohorts who underwent liver transplantation (LTx) versus those who did not. Among LTx cohorts, pre-LTx ATTR-PN disease duration ≥ 7 years, poor nutritional status, and late disease onset reduced median survival by 13, 12, and 10 years, respectively. Other prognostic survival factors included non-Val30Met genotype and baseline presence of urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or muscle weakness. CONCLUSION: Survival in patients with ATTR-PN is highly variable and affected by non-cardiac baseline characteristics, such as autonomic dysfunction, large fiber involvement, late-onset disease, and non-Val30Met mutation. Careful interpretation of these findings is warranted given that this synthesis did not control for differences between studies. Survival in patients with ATTR-PN remains poor among those who are untreated or with delayed diagnosis.","10.1007/s40120-020-00183-7","","Amyloidosis; Mortality; Polyneuropathy; Prognosis; Survival; Transthyretin","Journal Article"

Since NS3 helicase of ZIKV performs the critical function of unwinding double-stranded RNA during replication, it is considered as a promising drug target to block ZIKV replication. In the present study, we have exploited the NTPase site of ZIKV NS3 helicase for screening potential inhibitor compounds by molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches. NS3 helicase hydrolyzes the ATP to use its energy for unwinding RNA. We have chosen twenty natural compounds from ZINC library with known antiviral properties and a helicase focused library (HFL) of small molecules from Life Chemicals compounds. After going through docking, the top hit molecules from ZINC and HFL library were further analysed by MD simulations to find out stable binding poses.

However, because CTS is also common in the general population, we wanted to assess whether CTS, when associated with systemic manifestations, could help direct physicians to screen for TTR gene mutation and early diagnosis. METHODS: We reviewed the charts and interviewed the patients with hATTR seen between 2017 and 2018. We noted the details of CTS diagnosis, treatment, and other systemic features of the disease. RESULTS: Seventeen of the 23 patients studied had CTS. CTS was the first manifestation of the disease in 10 of 17 patients. On average, CTS symptoms occurred 10.4 years before their diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis. In 6 of 10 patients with CTS, the following systemic symptoms were present as the first manifestation: erectile dysfunction, dysautonomia, polyneuropathy, exercise intolerance, and gastrointestinal and ocular symptoms. CONCLUSION: CTS occurs in most patients with hATTR amyloidosis and frequently precedes the hATTR diagnosis. Most patients with CTS preceding hATTR diagnosis have systemic features.

Nowadays, no licensed vaccines or antivirals are available against ZIKV, and thus, in this very short time, the scientific community has conducted enormous efforts to develop vaccines and antivirals. So that, different platforms (purified inactivated and live attenuated viruses, DNA and RNA nucleic acid based candidates, virus-like particles, subunit elements, and recombinant viruses) have been evaluated as vaccine candidates. Overall, these vaccines have shown the induction of vigorous humoral and cellular responses, the decrease of viremia and viral RNA levels in natural target organs, the prevention of vertical and sexual transmission, as well as that of ZIKV-associated malformations, and the protection of experimental animal models. Some of these vaccine candidates have already been assayed in clinical trials. Likewise, the search for antivirals have also been the focus of recent investigations, with dozens of compounds tested in cell culture and a few in animal models. Both direct acting antivirals (DAAs), directed to viral structural proteins and enzymes, and host acting antivirals (HAAs), directed to cellular factors affecting all steps of the viral life cycle (binding, entry, fusion, transcription, translation, replication, maturation, and egress), have been evaluated. It is expected that this huge collaborative effort will produce affordable and effective therapeutic and prophylactic tools to combat ZIKV and other related still unknown or nowadays neglected flaviviruses.

Enkephalins exhibit the highest affinity for the δ receptor, followed by the μ and κ receptors, whereas ACTH binds to the five subtypes of melanocortin receptor, and is the only member of the melanocortin family of peptides that binds to the melanocortin-receptor 2 (ACTH receptor). Enkephalins/ACTH and their receptors exhibit a widespread anatomical distribution. Enkephalins are involved in analgesia, angiogenesis, blood pressure, embryonic development, emotional behavior, feeding, hypoxia, limbic system modulation, neuroprotection, peristalsis, and wound repair; as well as in hepatoprotective, motor, neuroendocrine and respiratory mechanisms. ACTH plays a role in acetylcholine release, aggressive behavior, blood pressure, bone maintenance, hyperalgesia, feeding, fever, grooming, learning, lipolysis, memory, nerve injury repair, neuroprotection, sexual behavior, sleep, social behavior, tissue growth and stimulates the synthesis and secretion of glucocorticoids.

Zika circulation elsewhere in the world, nonvector transmission including maternal-fetal/sexual/transfusion routes, and additional reports on congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) have been published. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2018-2019, ZIKV transmission occurred in Cuba, India, and is suspected to appear sporadically in other countries. Maternal-fetal ZIKV transmission appears to occur in about 26% of ZIKV-infected pregnant women. The US ZIKV Pregnancy and Infant Registry identified 6% of live births to have at least one ZIKV-associated birth defect; 9% had at least one neurodevelopmental abnormality; 1% had both. Infectious virus was rarely isolated from semen of ZIKV-infected male patients beyond day 38 after symptom onset. Brazilian blood donations had low ZIKV prevalence in 2015-2016; in the United States, screening donations was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico. SUMMARY: ZIKV transmission continues; many countries with competent mosquitoes are at risk. Transmission can occur without detection where surveillance is poor and laboratory capacity limited. Travelers are important sentinels. Variations exist among ZIKV strains and Aedes mosquitoes that influence competence for transmission. Maternal-fetal transmission results in significant rates of abnormality. Identification of infectious virus in semen clarifies sexual transmission risk, with updated recommendations for preconception planning. ZIKV neurotropism requires further research and long-term follow-up.","10.1097/QCO.0000000000000575","Disease Transmission, Infectious; Global Health; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Prevalence; Topography, Medical; Travel-Related Illness; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Review"

Community knowledge, perceptions and practices to prevent infection with the Zika virus are not well understood, particularly among high risk populations living in resource-poor and Zika-endemic areas. Our objective was to assess knowledge of symptoms, health effects and prevention practices associated with Zika virus in rural communities on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic. METHODS: Study participants were contacted while attending community events such as free medical clinics and invited to be interviewed regarding their knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of Zika virus using the World Health Organization's Zika survey tool. RESULTS: Of the 75 Dominicans that participated, 33% did not know who could become infected with Zika. In addition, only 40% of respondents were able to identify mosquitoes or sexual transmission as the primary routes of infection though 51% of respondents thought that Zika was an important issue in their community. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that general knowledge regarding the basic risks and transmission of Zika were not well understood among a sample of rural Dominicans. Our findings highlight disparities in knowledge and perception of risk from Zika in rural areas compared to previous studies conducted in the Dominican Republic. Education about the basic risks and transmission of Zika are critically needed in these remote populations to reduce Zika transmission.","10.1186/s12879-019-3952-0","Dominican Republic; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Rural Population; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Dominican Republic; KAP; Knowledge attitude and practices; Zika prevention; Zika virus","Journal Article"

This epidemic, which was declared an international public health emergency by the World Health Organization, has highlighted shortcomings in our current understanding of, and preparation for, emerging infectious diseases in general, as well as challenges that are specific to Zika virus infection. Vaccine development for Zika virus has been a high priority of the public health response, and several candidates have shown promise in pre-clinical and early phase clinical trials. The optimal selection and implementation of imperfect serologic assays are among the crucial issues that must be addressed in order to advance Zika vaccine development. Here, I review key considerations for how best to incorporate into Zika vaccine trials the existing serologic tools, as well as those on the horizon. Beyond that, this discussion is relevant to other intervention strategies to combat Zika and likely other emerging infectious diseases.","10.3390/tropicalmed4020068","","Zika; arbovirus; clinical trial; cross-reactivity; diagnostics; serology; vaccine; vector-borne disease; virus","Journal Article; Review"
30951637,"Detecting Vertical Zika Transmission: Emerging Diagnostic Approaches for an Emerged Flavivirus.","Collins MH; Waggoner JJ","ACS infectious diseases",2019,"Zika virus (Zika) was recently responsible for a massive epidemic that spread throughout Latin America and beyond. Though Zika is typically asymptomatic or self-limiting, the sheer numbers of Zika infections led to the identification of unexpected phenotypes including sexual transmission, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and teratogenicity. Thousands of infants in South, Central, and North America have now been born with microcephaly or one of a number of fetal anomalies constituting the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Diagnosing CZS is based on a combination of clinical risk assessment and laboratory testing (which includes determining whether the mother has experienced a possible Zika infection during her pregnancy). A newborn suspected of having congenital Zika infection (due to maternal Zika infection or a birth defect described in association with congenital Zika infection) is then specifically tested for presence of Zika virus in neonatal tissue or anti-Zika IgM in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Though the guidelines are clear, there is room for considerable practice variation to emerge from individualized patient-provider encounters, largely due to limitations in diagnostic testing for Zika. The natural history of Zika further obscures our ability to know who, when, and how to test. Molecular diagnostics are highly specific but may not serve well those with asymptomatic infection. Serologic assays expand the diagnostic window but are complicated by cross-reactivity among related flaviviruses and passive immunity transferred from mother to baby. Furthermore, existing and emerging diagnostic tools may not be widely available due to limitations in resources and infrastructure of health systems in affected areas. Improvements in assay parameters as well as advances in platforms and deployability hold promise for optimizing diagnostic approaches for congenital Zika infection. The diagnostic tools and technologies under development must be integrated with forthcoming clinical knowledge of congenital Zika infection to fully realize the value that laboratory testing holds for diagnosing in utero mother to child transmission but also for understanding, predicting, and managing the health outcomes due to congenital Zika infection.","10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00003","Antibodies, Viral; Early Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pregnancy; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","TORCHZ; Zika virus; congenital infection; flavivirus; maternal child health; molecular diagnostics; serodiagnostics; vertical transmission","Journal Article; Review"

From the mid-1940s, the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to -4) have caused 15 epidemics of variable severity. In 2013, for the first time, a sustained co-circulation of two different DENV serotypes (DENV-1 and -3) was reported. The same year, Zika virus (ZIKV) caused the largest outbreak ever recorded at that time. Severe neurologic complications in adults, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and central nervous system malformations in newborns and foeteuses, such as microcephaly, were reported, and a causal link with ZIKV infection was established. In addition to mosquito-borne transmission, the potential for perinatal, sexual and blood-transfusion transmission of ZIKV was demonstrated. In 2014, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused an explosive outbreak. Series of Guillain-Barré syndrome temporally associated with the CHIKV epidemic were reported. Except for DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV, no other arboviruses have been detected so far, but serologic evidence suggested the past silent circulation of Ross River virus. From May 2015 DENV-1 has been the only arbovirus transmitted in French Polynesia, but the reemergence of DENV-2 is highly expected since the detection of two autochthonous cases of DENV-2 infection in June 2018.","10.1016/j.nmni.2019.01.009","","Arbovirus; French Polynesia; Pacific; Ross River; Zika; chikungunya; dengue","Journal Article; Review"

Since then the virus has spread across Latin America, Caribbean, and North America. It seems clear that Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus are the main vectors of the pathogen. ZIKV infection symptoms are similar to other flaviviruses such as a dengue infection and therefore can be easily confounded. Currently, the ZIKV maintains two life cycles. The first, and the original one is the sylvatic/enzootic cycle that occurs in Africa. The second life cycle is the suburban-urban transmission cycle that emerged through natural evolution. ZIKV has gained the ability to maintain this human-endemic cycle in urban and suburban areas. ZIKV has never been isolated from non primates, so it is not clear whether other species can act as reservoir hosts. Several reports have been made of non-vector ZIKV transmission including breast-milk feeding, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse, saliva, urine, and physical contact (sweat, tears). A major global concern with ZIKV infection is the reported increase in cases of microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) in the Americas after the recent ZIKV outbreak. Currently, there is no available vaccine for ZIKV. Therefore, prevention of ZIKV infection must be emphasized by local public health authorities promoting collective responsibility and engagement for integrated vector management through environmental management, biological control, and as a last resource chemical control.",NA,"Aedes; Americas; Animals; Brazil; Environmental Health; Humans; Phylogeny; Public Health; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes aegypti; Americas; ZIKV","Journal Article"

Zika virus disease entered the Caribbean in 2013 with increased reporting of cases across the region in 2016, affecting more than 50 countries. This study aimed to ascertain the knowledge of, attitudes and practices towards Zika virus disease among antenatal clinic attenders in Trinidad and Tobago during the 2016 outbreak. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was undertaken. METHODS: A knowledge attitudes and practices survey was conducted among antenatal clinic attenders at publicly funded primary care health centres. All counties of Trinidad (except St Patrick, Caroni and Victoria) and Tobago were included in the study. Within each county, three health centres were selected at random. At the antenatal clinic of each selected health centre, antenatal clients were selected by randomly selecting their patient file from that day's antenatal clinic patient files. Data collection occurred from September to November 2016. The knowledge, attitudes and practice survey was administered by an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The World Health Organization Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice surveys Zika virus disease and potential complications Resource pack was adapted for use as the data collection tool. All data collected were analysed using SPSS software, version 23. Tests with P-values less than 0.05 were deemed significant. RESULTS: Seventy-four percent (74%) of responders did not think there was a link between sexual transmission and Zika. About 19% stated that abstaining could prevent Zika but only 6.6% actually practiced this. Seventy-six percent knew the risk of microcephaly, and this knowledge of the risk of microcephaly was found to be significantly associated with the number of weeks' gestation. Less than 40% knew the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Doctors at health centres followed by private doctors were the top two trusted information sources for responders. Responders thought that the government could spray insecticide, clean drains, educate community members and clean overgrown vacant lots of land. CONCLUSION: The government and healthcare workers need to reach specific target groups with accurate messages to minimize the associated morbidity and thereby safeguarding national and global health security.","10.1016/j.puhe.2018.09.025","Adolescent; Adult; Caribbean Region; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Pregnant People; Prenatal Care; Public Health Practice; Risk; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Zika Virus Infection","Attitudes; Global health; Knowledge; Practices; Pregnancy; Zika","Journal Article"

ZIKV infection has devastating consequences, such as neurological congenital malformations in infants born to infected mothers and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Additionally, its potential for transmission through vector bites, as well as from person to person through blood transfusions and sexual contact, are important considerations for prompt diagnosis. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal method, was developed as an alternative field-applicable assay to PCR. Here we report the development of a novel ZIKV real-time reverse transcriptase RPA (RT-RPA) assay capable of detecting a range of different ZIKV strains from a variety of geographical locations. The ZIKV RT-RPA was shown to be highly sensitive, being capable of detecting as few as five copies of target nucleic acid per reaction, and suitable for use with a battery-operated portable device. The ZIKV RT-RPA demonstrated 100 % specificity and 83 % sensitivity in clinical samples. Furthermore, we determined that the ZIKV RT-RPA is a versatile assay that can be applied to crude samples, such as saliva and serum, and can be used as a vector surveillance tool on crude mosquito homogenates.

Other ways of transmission include the perinatal and sexual routes, blood transfusion, and laboratory exposure. Although the first human cases were registered in 1952 in African countries, outbreaks were only reported since 2007, when entire Pacific islands were affected. In March 2015, the first cases of ZIKV acute infection were notified in Brazil and, to date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed local mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV. Until 2015, ZIKV infection was thought to only cause asymptomatic or mild exanthematous febrile infections. However, after explosive ZIKV outbreaks in Polynesia and Latin American countries, it was confirmed that ZIKV could also lead to Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital birth abnormalities. These abnormalities, which can include neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and skeletal findings, are now considered congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Brain abnormalities in CZS include cerebral calcifications, malformations of cortical development, ventriculomegaly, lissencephaly, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and brainstem. The ocular findings, which are present in up to 70% of infants with CZS, include iris coloboma, lens subluxation, cataract, congenital glaucoma, and especially posterior segment findings. Loss of retinal pigment epithelium, the presence of a thin choroid, a perivascular choroidal inflammatory infiltrate, and atrophic changes within the optic nerve were seen in histologic analyses of eyes from deceased fetuses. To date, there is no ZIKV licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies are available for treatment. Preventive measures include individual protection from mosquito bites, control of mosquito populations and the use of barriers measures such as condoms during sexual intercourse or sexual abstinence for couples either at risk or after confirmed infection. A literature review based on studies that analyzed ocular findings in mothers and infants with CZS, with or without microcephaly, was conducted and a theoretical pathophysiologic explanation for ZIKV-ocular abnormalities was formulated.","10.1016/j.preteyeres.2018.04.004","Eye Infections, Viral; Female; Humans; Microcephaly; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Review"

In most cases, it remained detected in blood from few days to 1 week after the onset of symptoms, and can persist longer in urine and in semen. ZIKV infection can have dramatic consequences such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. ZIKV sexual transmission has been documented. A better understanding of ZIKV presence and persistence across biologic compartments is needed to devise rational measures to prevent its transmission. METHODS: This observational cohort study will recruit non-pregnant participants aged 18 years and above with confirmed ZIKV infection [positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in blood and/or urine]: symptomatic men and women in ZIKV infection acute phase, and their symptomatic or asymptomatic household/sexual infected contacts. Specimens of blood, urine, semen, vaginal secretion/menstrual blood, rectal swab, oral fluids, tears, sweat, urine and breast milk (if applicable) will be collected at pre-established intervals and tested for ZIKV RNA presence by RT-PCR, other co-infection (dengue, Chikungunya, HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis), antibody response (including immunoglobulins M and G), plaque reduction neutralization test (if simultaneously positive for ZIKV and dengue), and ZIKV culture and RNA sequencing. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and comorbidities will be collected in parallel. Participants will be followed up for 12 months. DISCUSSION: This prolonged longitudinal follow-up of ZIKV infected persons with regular biologic testing and data collection will offer a unique opportunity to investigate the presence and persistence of ZIKV in various biologic compartments, their clinical and immunological correlates as well as the possibility of ZIKV reactivation/reinfection over time. This valuable information will substantially contribute to the body of knowledge on ZIKV infection and serve as a base for the development of more effective recommendation on the prevention of ZIKV transmission.

Zika rapidly spread across Brazil and to more than 50 other countries and territories on the American continent. The Aedesaegypti mosquito is thought to be the principal vector responsible for the widespread transmission of the virus. However, sexual transmission has also been reported. The explosively emerging epidemic has had diverse impacts on population health, coinciding with cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome and an unexpected epidemic of newborns with microcephaly and other neurological impairments. This led to Brazil declaring a national public health emergency in November 2015, followed by a similar decision by the World Health Organization three months later. While dengue virus serotypes took several decades to spread across Brazil, the Zika virus epidemic diffused within months, extending beyond the area of permanent dengue transmission, which is bound by a climatic barrier in the south and low population density areas in the north. This rapid spread was probably due to a combination of factors, including a massive susceptible population, climatic conditions conducive for the mosquito vector, alternative non-vector transmission, and a highly mobile population. The epidemic has since subsided, but many unanswered questions remain. In this article, we provide an overview of the discovery of Zika virus in Brazil, including its emergence and spread, epidemiological surveillance, vector and non-vector transmission routes, clinical complications, and socio-economic impacts.

A survey was administered in NYC adapted from the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey on Zika virus developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). METHODS: A standardized, self-administered, anonymous questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample in Manhattan and the Bronx from June 30th, 2016 to October 21st, 2016. Responses were grouped into six domains based on the content and structure of the questions and were summarized using descriptive statistics or converted into a continuous knowledge score and assessed for associations with pregnancy status and travel history using linear regression. RESULTS: There were 224 respondents with a mean age of 33 (SD ± 11.6) with 77% (170/224) female and 24% (51/224) pregnant. The majority (98% (213/217)) were unable to identify all of the symptoms associated with acute Zika virus infection and all modes of transmission (97% (213/219)). Most participants (85% (187/219)) identified mosquitoes as a mode of transmission. 95% (116/122) reported an association between Zika virus and microcephaly. The most concerning aspect of Zika virus in 46% (91/200) was the risk of disabilities to babies, and risk of sexual transmission (25% (49/200)). When asked what precautions pregnant persons should to reduce the risk of transmission when traveling to a Zika endemic region, only 27% (50/185) identified using condoms during intercourse or refraining from intercourse while pregnant. Knowledge of Zika transmission is significantly positively associated with pregnancy status, but not with travel history. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate an overall poor understanding of Zika virus symptoms and possible complications, transmission modes, and current recommended prevention guidelines. Pregnancy is positively associated with Knowledge of Zika Transmission, but not other knowledge scores. Reported travel history to Zika endemic regions is not significantly associated with Zika knowledge. There is a need for implementing future public health interventions that particularly focus on protection against Zika transmission, that Zika is sexually transmitted, and risks that the Guillain-Barré Syndrome poses a risk to adults.","10.1186/s12889-017-4991-3","Adult; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; New York City; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Pregnant People; Surveys and Questionnaires; Travel; Travel-Related Illness; Zika Virus Infection","Health promotion; Maternal health; Zika virus","Journal Article"

While sexual transmission and presence of ZIKV in urine, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva have been established, the origin of persistent virus shedding into biological secretions is not clear. Using a primary adult murine neuronal culture model, we have determined that ZIKV persistently and productively infects sensory neurons of the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia, which innervate glands and mucosa of the face and the genitourinary tract, respectively, without apparent injury. Autonomic neurons that innervate these regions are not permissive for infection. However, productive ZIKV infection of satellite glial cells that surround and support sensory and autonomic neurons in peripheral ganglia results in their destruction. Persistent infection of sensory neurons, without affecting their viability, provides a potential reservoir for viral shedding in biological secretions for extended periods of time after infection. Furthermore, viral destruction of satellite glial cells may contribute to the development of Guillain-Barré Syndrome via an alternative mechanism to the established autoimmune response.","10.3390/pathogens6040049","","Guillain-Barré; Zika virus; autonomic; neurons; satellite glial cells; sensory","Journal Article"

METHODS: Between June 6 and June 19, 2016 we conducted an online survey of doctors working in obstetrics and gynaecology, neonatology and paediatrics in Singapore. The survey included 15 multiple choice questions to measure respondents' knowledge of Zika virus in four domains covering clinical and public health. RESULTS: A total of 110 survey responses (15% response rate) were obtained, 82% of respondents worked in the public sector. Overall, the median respondent score was 9.4 (Max score=15), with substantial variation (range: 3.5 - 14.7). Microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome were recognised as causal complications of Zika virus infection by 99% and 50% of respondents respectively.  Clinical features which could help differentiate Zika from Dengue were less well understood with 50% and 68% correctly identifying conjunctivitis and low grade fever respectively. Worryingly, 14% favoured non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as part of treatment, without first excluding dengue as a diagnosis. Also, only 36% of respondents were aware of the current recommendation for preventing sexual transmission of Zika virus. Fewer than 50% were aware of the need for ophthalmological evaluation as part of congenital Zika virus infection. DISCUSSION: Our assessment demonstrates that there is good awareness of the clinical manifestation of Zika virus disease among key specialty doctors, but confusion with Dengue disease remains. It also highlights knowledge gaps in the prevention of sexually-transmitted Zika virus infection and the clinical management of congenital Zika virus infection in newborns. Our study identified strategic areas to improve communication to front-line doctors during public health response to the Zika epidemic.","10.1371/currents.outbreaks.44b19196298e01f3a6dcd4c09f235fa8","","","Journal Article"

Infection can cause microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that ZIKV is sexually transmitted, especially from infected males to uninfected females. This study aimed to investigate the transmission pattern of ZIKV in semen using boar semen. Experiments were performed ex vivo using semen from healthy boar. The samples were infected with ZIKV, and viral RNA was detected and cell morphology was examined at different time points postinfection. ZIKV infection was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Viral RNA levels were found to markedly decrease as the time postinfection increased, without any evidence of virus replication. The sperm showed no significant changes in morphology. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of virus-free sperm, suggesting that ZIKV cannot replicate in boar semen. We suggest three possible reasons underlying this phenomenon. First, the spermatozoa of boar might not be the target of ZIKV associated with sexual transmission. Second, the effect of the external environment on spermatozoa may affect ZIKV replication. Third, ZIKV may not be tropic for spermatozoa. This ex vivo study might be used as a platform to study the association of sexual transmission with ZIKV in other longer-lasting cells, such as Leydig or Sertoli cells.","10.1007/s00705-017-3453-7","Animals; Male; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Semen; Spermatozoa; Swine; Zika Virus","","Journal Article"
28638259,"Global Alert: Zika Virus-an Emerging Arbovirus.","Ozkurt Z; Tanriverdi EC","The Eurasian journal of medicine",2017,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus of the Flavivirus genus, and it has an envelope and a single RNA molecule. In early 2016, the World Health Organization declared ZIKV infection to be an emerging global health threat. The major transmission route of the virus to humans is Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV can be transmitted between humans by transplacental, perinatal, and sexual routes and via blood and body fluids. ZIKV infection usually results in a mild and self-limiting disease with low-grade fever, conjunctivitis, and periorbital edema. Neurological complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute myelitis, and transverse myelitis have been reported during ZIKV infection. Intrauterine and congenital ZIKV infections have strong teratogenic effects on the fetus. Intrauterine or congenital ZIKV infection can lead to microcephaly, ocular anomalies (such as macular atrophy, pigment mottling, and optic nerve anomalies), and cardiac anomalies (such as atrial or ventricular septal defect). Calcification in the brain between the cortical and subcortical areas, ventriculomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum hypoplasia, cortical/subcortical atrophy, delayed myelination, enlarged cisterna magna, and craniofacial disproportion have been reported as brain development defects. ZIKV infection usually results in a mild disease, and it does not require specific therapy. However, complications of infection during the early period of life are serious. Thus, many drugs have been investigated, and vaccine development studies have been conducted to prevent ZIKV infection. Vector control and personal protection from mosquito-borne transmission are important for decreasing the prevalence of ZIKV infection. In particular, pregnant residents or travelers to endemic areas should be carefully protected against mosquito-borne transmission. Zika virus (ZIKV), Flavivirus ailesinden sivrisineklerle bulaşan zarflı ve tek sarmallı RNA’ya sahip bir arbovirusdur. 2016 yılı başında Dünya Sağlık Örgütü (DSÖ) ZIKV enfeksiyonunun giderek önemi artan bir küresel tehdit olduğunu açıklamıştır. Virusun insanlara esas geçiş yolu Aedes tipi sivrisineklerin ısırmasıdır. İnsanlar arasında transplasental, perinatal, cinsel yolla, ayrıca kan ve vücut sıvıları aracılığı ile bulaşır. ZIKV enfeksiyonu genellikle hafif ve kendini sınırlandıran hastalık olup, düşük derecede ateş, konjuktivit ve periorbital ödem ile seyreder. ZIKV enfeksiyonu esnasında Guillain-Barre sendromu, meningoensefalit, akut dissemine ensefalomyelit (ADEM), akut myelit, transvers myelit gibi nörolojik komplikasyonlar rapor edilmiştir. Intrauterin ve konjenital ZIKV enfeksiyonu fetus üzerinde ağır teratojenik etkiye sahiptir. İntrauterin enfeksiyon mikrosefali, oküler anomaliler (maküler atrofi, pigment beneklenmesi ve optik sinir anomalileri gibi) ve kardiyak anomalilere (atrial veya ventriküler septal defekt gibi) yol açabilir. Beyin gelişim defektleri olarak kortikal ve subkortikal alanda kalsifikasyonlar, vetrikülomegali, serebellar hipoplazi, kortikal/subkortikal atrofi, korpus kallosum hipoplazisi, gecikmiş myelin gelişimi, geniş sisterna magna ve kraniofasiyal orantısızlık bildirilmiştir. ZIKV enfeksiyonu genellikle hafiftir ve tedavi gerektirmez. Fakat hayatın erken döneminde geçirilen enfeksiyonun komplikasyonları ciddidir. Bu yüzden ZIKV’e karşı pekçok ilaç araştırılmakta ve aşı geliştirme çalışmaları yürütülmektedir. Vektör kontrolü ve sivrisinek ısırığından korunmak için kişisel koruyucu önlemler ZIKV enfeksiyonunu azaltmak için önemlidir. Özellikle gebeler, endemik bölgede oturanlar ve seyahat edenler sivrisinek ısırığından dikkatice korunmalıdır.","10.5152/eurasianjmed.2017.17147","","Flavivirus; Guillain-Barré Syndrome; Zika virus; aedes; arbovirus; microcephaly","Journal Article; Review"

However, the recent massive ZIKV epidemics in the Americas have also linked ZIKV infection to fetal malformations like microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults, and have uncovered previously unrecognized routes of vertical and sexual transmission. Here we describe inhibition of ZIKV replication by suramin, originally an anti-parasitic drug, which was more recently shown to inhibit multiple viruses. In cell culture-based assays, using reduction of cytopathic effect as read-out, suramin had an EC50 of ∼40 μM and a selectivity index of 48. In single replication cycle experiments, suramin treatment also caused a strong dose-dependent decrease in intracellular ZIKV RNA levels and a >3-log reduction in infectious progeny titers. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that suramin inhibits a very early step of the replication cycle as well as the release of infectious progeny. Only during the first 2 h of infection suramin treatment strongly reduced the fraction of cells that became infected with ZIKV, suggesting the drug affects virus binding/entry. Binding experiments at 4 °C using 35S-labeled ZIKV demonstrated that suramin interferes with attachment to host cells. When suramin treatment was initiated post-entry, viral RNA synthesis was unaffected, while both the release of genomes and the infectivity of ZIKV were reduced. This suggests the compound also affects virion biogenesis, possibly by interfering with glycosylation and the maturation of ZIKV during its traffic through the secretory pathway. The inhibitory effect of suramin on ZIKV attachment and virion biogenesis and its broad-spectrum activity warrant further evaluation of this compound as a potential therapeutic.","10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.04.016","Animals; Chlorocebus aethiops; Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral; DNA Replication; Flavivirus; Glycosylation; Mycophenolic Acid; RNA, Viral; Suramin; Time Factors; Vero Cells; Virion; Virus Attachment; Virus Internalization; Virus Release; Virus Replication; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article"

In 2007, Zika virus appeared outside of its endemic borders in an outbreak on the South Pacific Island of Yap. In 2013, Zika virus was associated with a major neurological complication, Guillain-Barré syndrome, in a larger outbreak in the French Polynesian Islands. From the South Pacific, Zika invaded Brazil in 2015 and caused another severe neurological complication, fetal microcephaly. The mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus can be propagated by sexual transmission and, possibly, by blood transfusions, close personal contacts, and organ transplants, like other flaviviruses. Since these combined mechanisms of infectious disease transmission could result in catastrophic incidences of severe neurological diseases in adults and children, the public should know what to expect from Zika virus, how to prevent infection, and what the most likely failures in preventive measures will be. With federal research funding stalled, a Zika vaccine is far away. The only national strategies to prepare the United States for Zika virus invasion now are effective vector control measures and personal protection from mosquito bites. In addition to a basic knowledge of Aedes mosquito vectors and their biting behaviors, an understanding of simple household vector control measures, and the selection of the best chemical and physical mosquito repellents will be required to repel the Zika threat.","10.1016/j.wem.2016.07.006","Aedes; Animals; Brazil; Female; Humans; Insect Bites and Stings; Male; Mosquito Control; Mosquito Vectors; United States; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes aegypti; Aedes albopictus; Zika virus; arboviruses; mosquito-borne infectious diseases","Editorial"

If symptoms do occur, individuals display a low-grade fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis 2 to 7 d after infection. Infection is concerning due to its associated fetal effects in pregnant women and relationship with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Diagnosis should be suspected in individuals with the appropriate symptomatology and exposure history. Diagnostic tests for the Zika virus are available and vary based on symptom duration.

We examined demographic and travel-related characteristics of returned Canadian travellers with Zika infection acquired in the Americas to illuminate risk factors for acquisition and the clinical spectrum. METHODS: We analyzed demographic and travel-related data for returned Canadian travellers who presented to a CanTravNet site between October 2015 and September 2016 for care of Zika virus acquired in the Americas. Data were collected with use of the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network data platform. RESULTS: During the study period, 1118 travellers presented to a CanTravNet site after returning from the Americas, 41 (3.7%) of whom had Zika infection. Zika infection from the Americas was diagnosed at CanTravNet sites as often as dengue (n = 41) over the study period. In the first half of the study period, Zika virus burden was borne by people visiting friends and relatives in South America. In the latter half, coincident with the increased spread of Zika throughout the Caribbean and Central America, Zika virus occurred more often in tourists in the Caribbean. Forty (98%) of the travellers with Zika infection acquired it through probable mosquito exposure, and 1 had confirmed sexual acquisition. Congenital transmission occurred in 2 of 3 pregnancies. Two (5%) of those with Zika had symptoms resembling those of Guillain-Barré syndrome, 1 of whom also had Zika viral meningitis. INTERPRETATION: Even in this small cohort, we observed the full clinical spectrum of acute Zika virus, including adverse fetal and neurologic outcomes.

Treatment for ZIKV disease is supportive. Those in ZIKV endemic areas should protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing insect repellent, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants when outdoors, and/or using air conditioning or window screens when indoors. Furthermore, unprotected sexual intercourse should be temporarily avoided by those who recently traveled to endemic areas.

The virus was isolated in 1947 from a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda. The virus causes sporadic mild human infections in Africa and later in Asia. However, by 2007 a major shift in its infection pattern was noticed and thousands of human infections were reported in the State of Yap and Federated States of Micronesia. In the last 3 years, major outbreaks have continued to occur and the virus has spread to several Pacific and American countries. These outbreaks were mostly asymptomatic; however, there were more severe clinical signs associated with the infections. Those signs included microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome. It is believed that various species of mosquitoes can biologically transmit the virus. However, Aedes aegypti is most widely associated with the Zika virus. Recently, new modes of virus transmission have been reported, including mother-to-fetus, sexual, blood transfusion, animal bites, laboratory exposure and breast milk. Differential diagnosis is very important as some other arboviruses such as yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus have similar clinical manifestations to the Zika virus infection as well as relating serologically to some of these viruses. Established laboratory diagnostic tests to detect the Zika virus are limited, with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction being the most widely used test. Taking into consideration the quickness of the spread of infection, size of the infected population and change of the infection severity pattern, the Zika virus infection merits collective efforts on all levels to prevent and control the disease. Limited research work and data, concurrent infection with other arboviruses, involvement of biological vectors, mass crowd events, human and trade movements and lack of vaccines are some of the challenges that we face in our efforts to prevent and control the Zika virus infection. ملخص البحث: تهدف هذه المراجعة إلى تسليط الضوء على فيروس زيكا والذي اكتشف سنة 1947 من قرد الريسوس في غابة الزيكا في أوغندا. يسبب هذا الفيروس عدوى متقطعة لدى الإنسان في بعض الدول الإفريقية والأسيوية. وخلال السنوات الثلاثة الأخيرة حدث انتشار واسع في عدة مناطق أخرى وخاصة في دول أمريكا الوسطى والجنوبية وكان هذا الانتشار مصحوبا ببعض العلامات السريرية الخطيرة كصغر رأس الجنين ومتلازمة غيان بـــــاري (Guillan – Barre syndrome). تقوم بعوضة تدعى (Aedos aegypti) بنقل هذا الفيروس إلى البشر، كما يمكن نقله من الأم إلى الجنين وعن طريق التواصل الجنسي، نقل الدم ومشتقاته وحليب الأم. يناقش الكاتب كيفية التصدي لهذا الفيروس الذي يتطلب تكاتف جماعي وعلى كل المستويات.","10.4103/1658-631X.194260","","Arbovirus; Zika virus; microcephaly; review; zoonotic","Journal Article; Review"

Subsequently, eligibility was expanded to pregnant women with sexual partners with similar travel histories. Serum and urine collected within 4 weeks of symptom onset or within 6 weeks of travel were tested with real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays targeting the ZKV envelope and NS2B genes.

Zika is a single-stranded RNA arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family. The primary source of infection in humans stems from Aedes aegypti mosquito bites but can also occur through sexual, blood, and perinatal transmission. With expectations that 3 to 4 million people across the Americas will be infected over the next year, the World Health Organization has declared this event a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. OBSERVATIONS: Although acute Zika virus infection is typically mild and self-limited, researchers have demonstrated serious neurologic complications associated with it such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Otolaryngologists should be aware of head and neck manifestations which include conjunctivitis, retro-orbital pain, cephalgia, and odynophagia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed specific molecular and serologic testing protocols and algorithms for follow-up care of suspected cases. Currently, the mainstay of management is conservative care while researchers attempt to develop a vaccine. Strategies to contain the Zika virus include vector control, travel restriction for women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, and avoidance of mosquito bites in endemic regions of the world. CONCLUSIONS AND REVELANCE: The future outlook regarding the current Zika virus outbreak in the Americas remains uncertain.

METHODS: This study outlines the clinical features, potential for teratogenicity, diagnosis, and treatment of ZIKV infection. RESULTS: Zika virus is transmitted through the bite of an infected Stegomyia (= Aedes) mosquito, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse, and perinatal routes. Infection has been characterized as mildly symptomatic. Symptoms include mild fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, non-purulent conjunctivitis, and a pruritic maculopapular rash. It is rarely life-threatening, but both Guillain-Barré syndrome and fetal microcephaly have been reported. ZIKV belongs to the same family as bovine viral diarrhea virus, which causes hydrocephalus and microcephaly in newborn calves, and hepatitis C virus, which can be vertically transmitted in human pregnancies, and hence there remains concern for potential similarities. Diagnostic methods include polymerase chain reaction performed in blood samples during infection, and in urine and saliva. Pregnant women undergo antibody testing for immunoglobulin M. Treatment involves supportive care, and acetaminophen and antihistamines to control symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no evidence of the circulation of ZIKV in the Western hemisphere prior to 2014, the global spread of Stegomyia aegypti and increases in urban populations and international travel have fostered its evolution. Adherence to current guidelines for the prevention of ZIKV transmission is especially relevant in regions experiencing ongoing outbreaks. Concern for microcephaly in newborns warrants further investigation into the potential long-term effects of ZIKV infection, especially in relation to reproductive health and mother-fetus transmission.","10.1111/ijd.13399","Americas; Disease Outbreaks; Female; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Microcephaly; Micronesia; Polynesia; Pregnancy; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","disease control; tropical disease; viral disease","Historical Article; Journal Article"

Prior to 2007, ZIKV was associated with only sporadic human infections with minimal or no clinical manifestations. Recently the virus has caused disease outbreaks from the Pacific Islands, the Americas, and off the coast of West Africa with approximately 1.62 million people suspected to be infected in more than 60 countries around the globe. The recent ZIKV outbreaks have been associated with guillain-barré syndrome, congenital syndrome (microcephaly, congenital central nervous system anomalies), miscarriages, and even death. This review summarizes the path of ZIKV outbreak within the last decade, highlights three novel modes of ZIKV transmission associated with recent outbreaks, and points to the hallmarks of congenital syndrome. The review concludes with a summary of challenges facing ZIKV research especially the control of ZIKV infection in the wake of most recent data showing that anti-dengue virus antibodies enhance ZIKV infection.","10.1186/s12985-016-0623-2","Aedes; Africa, Western; Americas; Animals; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Mosquito Vectors; Pacific Islands; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Antibody-dependent enhancement; Microcephaly; Neurological development; Sexual transmission; Zika virus","Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
27708473,"Zika: the origin and spread of a mosquito-borne virus.","Kindhauser MK; Allen T; Frank V; Santhana RS; Dye C","Bulletin of the World Health Organization",2016,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the temporal and geographical distribution of Zika virus infection and associated neurological disorders, from 1947 to 1 February 2016, when Zika became a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). METHODS: We did a literature search using the terms ""Zika"" and ""ZIKV"" in PubMed, cross-checked the findings for completeness against other published reviews and added formal notifications to WHO submitted under the International Health Regulations. FINDINGS: From the discovery of Zika virus in Uganda in 1947 to the declaration of a PHEIC by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 1 February 2016, a total of 74 countries and territories had reported human Zika virus infections. The timeline in this paper charts the discovery of the virus (1947), its isolation from mosquitos (1948), the first human infection (1952), the initial spread of infection from Asia to a Pacific island (2007), the first known instance of sexual transmission (2008), reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome (2014) and microcephaly (2015) linked to Zika infections and the first appearance of Zika in the Americas (from 2015). CONCLUSION: Zika virus infection in humans appears to have changed in character as its geographical range has expanded from equatorial Africa and Asia. The change is from an endemic, mosquito-borne infection causing mild illness to one that can cause large outbreaks linked with neurological sequelae and congenital abnormalities. OBJECTIF: Décrire la répartition temporelle et géographique de la maladie à virus Zika et des troubles neurologiques qui lui sont associés de 1947 au 1er février 2016, date à laquelle le virus Zika est devenu une urgence de santé publique de portée internationale (USPPI). MÉTHODES: Nous avons réalisé une recherche bibliographique en saisissant les termes «Zika» et «ZIKV» dans PubMed, puis vérifié par recoupement l'exhaustivité des données recueillies par rapport à d'autres études publiées et ajouté à l'intention de l'OMS des avis formels soumis en vertu du Règlement sanitaire international. RÉSULTATS: De la découverte du virus Zika en Ouganda en 1947 à la déclaration d'une USPPI par l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) le 1er février 2016, 74 pays et territoires ont signalé des cas d'infections humaines par le virus Zika. La chronologie présentée dans cette étude rend compte de la découverte du virus (1947), de son isolement chez des moustiques (1948), de la première infection humaine (1952), de la propagation initiale de l'infection de l'Asie à une île du Pacifique (2007), du premier cas connu de transmission sexuelle (2008), de cas de syndrome de Guillain-Barré (2014) et de microcéphalie (2015) liés à des infections par le virus Zika et de la première apparition du virus Zika sur le continent américain (à partir de 2015). CONCLUSION: L’infection humaine par le virus Zika semble avoir changé de nature à mesure de l'élargissement de sa portée géographique à partir de l'Afrique équatoriale et de l'Asie. Cette infection endémique transmise par des moustiques qui provoquait des symptômes bénins est désormais à l'origine de flambées importantes associées à des séquelles neurologiques et anomalies congénitales. OBJETIVO: Describir la distribución temporal y geográfica de la infección por el virus de Zika y los trastornos neurológicos asociados, del 1947 al 1 de febrero de 2016, cuando el zika se convirtió en una emergencia de salud pública de importancia internacional (ESPII). MÉTODOS: Se realizó un análisis documental utilizando los términos “Zika” y “ZIKV” en PubMed, se realizó una comprobación cruzada de los resultados para analizar su integridad frente a otras publicaciones y se añadieron notificaciones formales a la OMS, emitidas según el Reglamento Sanitario Internacional. RESULTADOS: Desde el descubrimiento del virus de Zika en Uganda en 1947 hasta que la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declaró que se trataba de una ESPII el 1 de febrero de 2016, un total de 74 países y territorios registraron infecciones por el virus de Zika en humanos. El cronograma de este documento enuncia el descubrimiento del virus (1947), su aislamiento de los mosquitos (1948), el primer contagio humano (1952), la primera propagación de la infección de Asia a una isla del Pacífico (2007), el primer caso conocido de transmisión sexual (2008), informes del síndrome de Guillain-Barré (2014) y la microcefalia (2015) asociados a las infecciones de zika y la primera aparición de zika en el continente americano (a partir de 2015). CONCLUSIÓN: La infección por el virus de Zika en humanos parece haber cambiado de naturaleza, conforme su alcance geográfico se ha ampliado del África ecuatorial a Asia. Este cambio se ha producido al pasar de una infección endémica transmitida por mosquitos que provocaba una enfermedad leve a una que puede derivar en grandes brotes vinculados con secuelas neurológicas y anomalías congénitas. الغرض: توضيح التوزيع الزمني والجغرافي لانتشار عدوى فيروس زيكا واضطرابات الجهاز العصبي المرتبطة به، منذ عام 1947 حتى 1 فبراير 2016، عندما أصبح فيروس زيكا يمثل طارئة من طوارئ الصحة العمومية التي تثير قلقًا دوليًا (PHEIC). الطريقة: أجرينا بحثًا في الكتابات باستخدام مصطلحي ""Zika"" و""ZIKV"" في محرك البحث PubMed، وتحققنا من النتائج من حيث اكتمالها بمقارنتها بمراجعات أخرى تم نشرها وأضفنا إخطارات رسمية لمنظمة الصحة العالمية تم تقديمها بموجب اللوائح الصحية الدولية. النتائج: أبلغ عدد من الدول يبلغ في مجمله 74 دولة ومنطقة إقليمية عن وجود حالات للإصابة بعدوى فيروس زيكا، وذلك منذ اكتشاف فيروس زيكا في أوغندا عام 1974 حتى إعلان منظمة الصحة العالمية (WHO) اعتبار الإصابة بهذا الفيروس طارئة من طوارئ الصحة العمومية التي تثير قلقًا دوليًا في 1 فبراير 2016. ويمكن تسجيل مراحل اكتشاف المرض بجدول زمني في هذا التقرير على النحو التالي: اكتشاف الفيروس (1947)، وعزله من الناموس (1948)، وأول إصابة بشرية بالعدوى (1952)، والانتقال الأولي للعدوى من آسيا إلى جزر المحيط الهادئ (2007)، وأول حالة تم التعرف عليها لانتقال العدوى جنسيًا (2008)، والإبلاغ بحالات متلازمة غيّان – باريه (2014) وصغر الرأس (2015) المرتبطة بحالات الإصابة بعدوى زيكا، وأول ظهور لمرض زيكا في الأمريكتين (منذ 2015). الاستنتاج: يبدو أن الإصابة بعدوى فيروس زيكا لدى البشر تغيرت طبيعتها مع اتساع نطاق انتشارها جغرافيًا من المناطق الاستوائية في آسيا وأفريقيا. فقد ظهر التحول من العدوى المتوطنة التي ينقلها البعوض الحامل للفيروس والتي تتسبب في الإصابة بأمراض خفيفة الوطأة إلى عدوى قد تسبب حالات واسعة الانتشار ترتبط بظهور مضاعفات بالجهاز العصبي وتشوهات خلقية. 目的: 描述从 1947 年至 2016 年 2 月 1 日期间，寨卡病毒感染以及相关的神经系统疾病的时间和地理分布。现在，寨卡病毒已成为一项国际公共卫生紧急事件 (PHEIC)。. 方法: 我们在 PubMed 上使用术语“寨卡”和“ZIKV”进行了文献查询，对比其他已发布文献综述交叉检查了结果的完整性，并且按照《国际卫生条例》向世界卫生组织 (WHO) 作出了有关该病毒的正式通知。. 结果: 从寨卡病毒于 1947 年在乌干达被首次发现，到 2016 年 2 月 1 日被世界卫生组织 (WHO) 宣布为国际公共卫生紧急事件 (PHEIC)，已共有 74 个国家和地区报告出现人类寨卡病毒感染病例。该论文中的时间线跟踪记录了该病毒的发现 (1947)、从蚊子体内分离出病毒 (1948)、第一例人类感染 (1952)、从亚洲向太平洋岛屿的首次传播 (2007)、第一例已知的寨卡性传播病例 (2008)、格林-巴利综合症相关报道 (2014)、寨卡病毒感染相关的小头症 (2015) 以及美洲大陆的首例寨卡病例（自 2015 年以来）。. 结论: 人类寨卡病毒感染的特征似乎已经改变，因为其地理范围已经开始从赤道非洲和亚洲逐渐向其他地区扩展。这是一种从引起轻微病症的地方性蚊媒感染向可引起神经系统后遗症和先天性畸形的大规模疫情的转变。. ЦЕЛЬ: Описать временное и территориальное распределение заражения вирусом Зика и сопряженных неврологических нарушений с 1947 года до 1 февраля 2016 года, когда вирус Зика получил статус чрезвычайной ситуации в области общественного здравоохранения, имеющей международное значение (PHEIC). МЕТОДЫ: Авторы выполнили поиск литературы с условиями поиска Zika и ZIKV (вирус Зика) в базе данных PubMed, подвергли результаты перекрестной сверке с результатами других опубликованных анализов, чтобы убедиться в их полноте, и добавили официальные уведомления для ВОЗ, которые были представлены в соответствии с международными медико-санитарными правилами. РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: С момента обнаружения вируса Зика в Уганде в 1947 году до провозглашения Всемирной организацией здравоохранения (ВОЗ) 1 февраля 2016 года чрезвычайной ситуации в области общественного здравоохранения, имеющей международное значение (PHEIC), случаи заражения человека вирусом Зика были зарегистрированы в общей сложности в 74 странах и регионах. Хронология в данном документе включает обнаружение вируса (1947 год), его выделение из комаров (1948 год), первое заражение человека (1952 год), первоначальное распространение инфекции из Азии в Океанию (2007 год), первый известный случай передачи вируса половым путем (2008 год), сообщения о синдроме Гийена-Барре (2014 год) и микроцефалии (2015 год), связанных с заражениями вирусом Зика, и первое появление вируса Зика в Америке (с 2015 года). ВЫВОД: Судя по всему, характер заражения людей вирусом Зика изменился с расширением его географического распространения из экваториальной Африки и Азии. Эндемическая, переносимая комарами инфекция, которая вызывает болезнь, протекающую в легкой форме, трансформировалась в инфекцию, способную вызывать масштабные вспышки, связанные с неврологическими последствиями и врожденными аномалиями.","10.2471/BLT.16.171082","Aedes; Africa; Animals; Asia; Disease Outbreaks; Geography; Global Health; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Macaca mulatta; Microcephaly; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Historical Article; Journal Article"

Most Zika virus infections are subclinical or characterized by mild febrile illness. However, neurological complications, including Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults, and congenital anomalies, including microcephaly in babies born to infected mothers, raised a grave concern. Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available for Zika virus infection.

METHODS: Electronic databases of PubMed, WHO, CDC, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Google, and Cochrane library were extensively searched for ZIKV. Articles were reviewed, scrutinized and critically appraised and the most relevant articles were utilized. RESULTS: ZIKV is an emerging Flavivirus which was first isolated from Uganda in 1947. It is transmitted mainly through bite of Aedes mosquitoes. Sexual, perinatal and blood-borne transmissions are implicated. ZIKV is incriminated to cause microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. The spiky spread of ZIKV and its epidemic potential are especially problematic in countries which host big MGs with endogenous ZIKV circulation. This put millions of international travelers and local inhabitants at risk of acquiring ZIKV, especially in absence of vaccine until now. Brazil Olympic and Paralympics Games, and Muslims Hajj in Saudi Arabia are important upcoming MGs. Regarding Brazil, swiftly epidemic of ZIKV causes phobia and provokes claims and counter-claims about possible postponing or cancellation of such events. RECOMMENDATIONS: Intensifying ZIKV epidemiological surveillance (sentinel, syndromic, environmental, laboratory and electronic), and conduction of educational programs are required. Controlling Aedes vector (chemically & biologically) is essential.

Morbidity and mortality weekly report",2016,"Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus primarily transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (1). Zika virus infections have also been documented through intrauterine transmission resulting in congenital infection; intrapartum transmission from a viremic mother to her newborn; sexual transmission; blood transfusion; and laboratory exposure (1-5). Most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic (1,6). Clinical illness, when it occurs, is generally mild and characterized by acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or nonpurulent conjunctivitis. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause adverse outcomes such as fetal loss, and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies (1-3). Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare autoimmune condition affecting the peripheral nervous system, also has been associated with Zika virus infection (1). Following the identification of local transmission of Zika virus in Brazil in May 2015, the virus has continued to spread throughout the Region of the Americas, and travel-associated cases have increased (7). In 2016, Zika virus disease and congenital infections became nationally notifiable conditions in the United States (8). As of September 3, 2016, a total of 2,382 confirmed and probable cases of Zika virus disease with symptom onset during January 1-July 31, 2016, had been reported from 48 of 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Most cases (2,354; 99%) were travel-associated, with either direct travel or an epidemiologic link to a traveler to a Zika virus-affected area. Twenty-eight (1%) cases were reported as locally acquired, including 26 associated with mosquito-borne transmission, one acquired in a laboratory, and one with an unknown mode of transmission. Zika virus disease should be considered in patients with compatible clinical signs or symptoms who traveled to or reside in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission or who had unprotected sex with someone who traveled to those areas. Health care providers should continue to educate patients, especially pregnant women, about the importance of avoiding infection with Zika virus, and all pregnant women should be assessed for possible Zika virus exposure at each prenatal visit (2).","10.15585/mmwr.mm6536e5","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; District of Columbia; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Travel; United States; Young Adult; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article"

The virus has emerged in recent years and spread in the Pacific Area and the Americas, where it has caused large human outbreaks. The factors involved in the virus's emergence are still unknown, but probably include its introduction in naïve environments characterised by the presence of high densities of competent Aedes spp. mosquitoes and susceptible human hosts in urban areas. Unique features of Zika virus infection are sexual and transplacental transmission and associated neurological morbidities, i.e. Guillain-Barré syndrome and fetal microcephaly. Diagnosis relies on the detection of viral nucleic acids in biological samples, while detection of a specific antibody response may be inconclusive because of the broad cross-reactivity of antibodies among flaviviruses. Experimental studies have clarified some mechanisms of Zika virus pathogenesis and have identified potential targets for antiviral drugs. In animal models, the virus can infect and efficiently replicate in the placenta and in the brain, and induce fetal demise or neural damage, recapitulating human diseases.

Virus is closely related with other flaviviruses; dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus phylogenetically. Due to the possible relationship between virus and clinical features including microcephaly, ventricule, and eye deformities, Guillain-Barre syndrome increases the interest on this virus gradually. Along with the vector-borne transmission, exposure via blood transfusion and sexual contact are further concerns.

Since January 2015, 41 countries reported autochthonous cases. In Brazil, an increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly cases was linked to ZIKV infections. A recent report describing low experimental transmission efficiency of its main putative vector, Ae. aegypti, in conjunction with apparent sexual transmission notifications, prompted the investigation of other potential sources of viral dissemination. Urine and saliva have been previously established as useful tools in ZIKV diagnosis. Here, we described the presence and isolation of infectious ZIKV particles from saliva and urine of acute phase patients in the Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nine urine and five saliva samples from nine patients from Rio de Janeiro presenting rash and other typical Zika acute phase symptoms were inoculated in Vero cell culture and submitted to specific ZIKV RNA detection and quantification through, respectively, NAT-Zika, RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. Two ZIKV isolates were achieved, one from urine and one from saliva specimens. ZIKV nucleic acid was identified by all methods in four patients. Whenever both urine and saliva samples were available from the same patient, urine viral loads were higher, corroborating the general sense that it is a better source for ZIKV molecular diagnostic. In spite of this, from the two isolated strains, each from one patient, only one derived from urine, suggesting that other factors, like the acidic nature of this fluid, might interfere with virion infectivity. The complete genome of both ZIKV isolates was obtained. Phylogenetic analysis revealed similarity with strains previously isolated during the South America outbreak. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The detection of infectious ZIKV particles in urine and saliva of patients during the acute phase may represent a critical factor in the spread of virus.

More than one million people have been infected since the appearance of the virus in Brazil in 2015. Approximately 80% of infected patients are asymptomatic. An association with microcephaly and other birth defects as well as Guillain-Barre Syndrome has led to a World Health Organization declaration of Zika virus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Zika virus is a vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Male to female sexual transmission has been reported and there is potential for transmission via blood transfusions. After an incubation period of 2-7 days, symptomatic patients develop rapid onset fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis, often associated with headache and myalgias. Emergency department (ED) personnel must be prepared to address concerns from patients presenting with symptoms consistent with acute Zika virus infection, especially those who are pregnant or planning travel to Zika-endemic regions, as well as those women planning to become pregnant and their partners. The identify-isolate-inform (3I) tool, originally conceived for initial detection and management of Ebola virus disease patients in the ED, and later adjusted for measles and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, can be adapted for real-time use for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I tool for initial detection and management of patients under investigation for Zika virus. Following an assessment of epidemiologic risk, including travel to countries with mosquitoes that transmit Zika virus, patients are further investigated if clinically indicated. If after a rapid evaluation, Zika or other arthropod-borne diseases are the only concern, isolation (contact, droplet, airborne) is unnecessary. Zika is a reportable disease and thus appropriate health authorities must be notified. The modified 3I tool will facilitate rapid analysis and triggering of appropriate actions for patients presenting to the ED at risk for Zika.","10.5811/westjem.2016.3.30188","Communicable Disease Control; Decision Support Techniques; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Male; Patient Isolation; Population Surveillance; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Travel; World Health Organization; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article"

In addition to the vector-mediated transmission of Zika fever, probable human-to-human transmission through exchange of body fluids, including sexual and perinatal transmission and through blood transfusion, makes containment of this new entity more challenging. Moreover, a high index of suspicion by an astute physician is necessary for diagnosis of Zika fever in view of the similarity of symptoms with dengue and chikungunya, especially in areas, where these two diseases are already endemic. Zika, till recently, has had minimal impact, but its true potential is unfolding with increasing detection of congenital malformities, Guillain-Barré syndrome and other neurological and autoimmune syndromes in patients with recent history of ZIKV infection, or when mothers get infected with Zika during first or second trimester of pregnancy.

The extent of spread depends on the travel volume and the endemicity in the exporting country. In the absence of reliable surveillance data, we did mathematical modelling to estimate the number of importations of ZIKV from Brazil into Europe. DESIGN: We applied a previously developed mathematical model on importations of dengue to estimate the number of ZIKV importations into Europe, based on the travel volume, the probability of being infected at the time of travel, the population size of Brazil, and the estimated incidence of ZIKV infections. RESULTS: Our model estimated between 508 and 1,778 imported infections into Europe in 2016, of which we would expect between 116 and 355 symptomatic Zika infections; with the highest number of importations being into France, Portugal and Italy. CONCLUSIONS: Our model identified high-risk countries in Europe. Such data can assist policymakers and public health professionals in estimating the extent of importations in order to prepare for the scale up of laboratory diagnostic assays and estimate the occurrence of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, potential sexual transmission, and infants with congenital ZIKV syndrome.","10.3402/gha.v9.31669","","Brazil; Europe; Zika virus; importations; travel","Journal Article"

OBSERVATIONS: In this review, we discuss what is currently known about ZIKV, neuroimmunologic complications, and the impact on global human health. Zika virus spread across Africa and Asia in part owing to unique genomic evolutionary conditions and pressures resulting in specific human disease manifestations, complications, and pathogenesis. Recent data suggest that acute ZIKV infection in pregnant women may result in acute infection of fetal tissue and brain tissue, causing microcephaly and potentially severe debilitation of the infant or even death of the fetus. Cases of acute ZIKV are also associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. With the increased number of cases, new complications such as ocular involvement and sexual transmission have been reported. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Zika virus is an emerging viral pathogen with significant consequences on human health throughout the world. Ongoing research into this pathogen is urgently needed to produce viable vaccine and therapeutic options.","10.1001/jamaneurol.2016.0800","Animals; Female; Humans; Male; Nervous System Diseases; Pregnancy; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Review"
27175508,"[Global spread of Zika virus epidemic: current knowledges and uncertainties].","Şahiner F","Mikrobiyoloji bulteni",2016,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. Although more than 60 years have passed since the discovery and first reported human cases of the virus, only a small number (< 10) of cases had been encountered in the literature until the last 10 years. Zika virus was known as a virus which caused sporadic infections and was confined to Africa and Asia along a narrow equatorial line. In 2007, however, the first major outbreak of ZIKV occurred in Yap Island (Micronesia), and so it was reported for the first time outside of Africa and Asia. Between the years of 2007 and 2014, ZIKV spreaded to island groups located in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean, and in 2015-2016, it has spread to South and Central America and the Caribbean. Today, travel-related imported cases is still been reported in Europe, North America, and other countries in the Far East. According to the data from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of March 2016, ZIKV infections have already spread locally in more than 30 countries, and travel alerts have been issued for the countries where the virus is present. Zika virus infections are generally asymptomatic or may present with a moderate clinical picture (e.g. acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, and nonpurulent conjunctivitis). Although no deaths were attributed to ZIKV infection over the past 60 years, as of November 2015, it has been suggested that three deaths in Brazil, including the death of a newborn with microcephaly, may be attributed to ZIKV infection. In addition, concurrent with outbreaks in 2013 in French Polynesia and in 2015 in Brazil, there have been significant rises reported in the incidence of some autoimmune and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly; these reports have caused considerable international concern. There are many points that are still unclear about ZIKV, including: (1) intrauterine transmission risk, frequency, and effects of the infection on fetal development; (2) the probability of perinatal transmission and if so the possible risks; (3) association with autoimmune and neurological diseases, and presence of long-term sequelae risks after infection; (4) possible routes of transmission other than mosquito bites, such as sexual contact, blood transfusion, and other body fluids (saliva, semen, or urine); (5) presence of reservoir(s) and different mosquito vectors; (6) diagnostic difficulties including cross reactivity in serological tests and standardization of testing procedures; (7) severity of the infection in immunocompromised patients; and (8) the potential effectiveness of antiviral therapy or preventive vaccines. In this review, updated information and recommendations regarding ZIKV outbreaks and risks, and the epidemiology, diagnosis and characteristics of ZIKV infections, are summarized in light of the most recent literature.","10.5578/mb.24167","Epidemics; Global Health; Humans; Risk Factors; Zika Virus Infection","","English Abstract; Journal Article; Review"
27157106,"Zika Virus: What Do Emergency Physicians Need to Know?","Long D; Long B; Koyfman A","The Journal of emergency medicine",2016,"BACKGROUND: Zika virus currently dominates headlines, creating public fear due to its complications. With the ease of worldwide travel, this disease has spread rapidly to the U.S. OBJECTIVES: To provide physicians with an updated clinical review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, and mimics of zika virus. DISCUSSION: This flavivirus is spread by the bite of the Aedes mosquito during daylight. The ease of worldwide travel has allowed the virus to spread to Mexico and the U.S. Main transmission route is via blood contact or sexual activity involving mucous membranes. Incubation ranges from 2 to 12 days, but only 20% of patients experience symptoms. Fever is low grade with conjunctivitis, arthralgias, myalgias, and a maculopapular rash. Chikungunya and Dengue Fever differ in that patients experience higher fever and no conjunctivitits. The dreaded complication of Zika virus is microcephaly in infants born to infected mothers. Guillain-Barre Syndrome is also linked to the virus. Historical factors including travel history are paramount, and diagnosis includes PCR or serology. No current treatment regimen exists beyond symptom control. The emergency physician must seek to rule out other similar diseases such as malaria, chikungunya, and dengue fever. CONCLUSION: Zika virus has created public fear due to complications, and this flavivirus spread by the Aedes mosquito presents similarly to Chikungunya and Dengue Fever. The dreaded complication of Zika virus is microcephaly in infants born to infected mothers. This review provides key information concerning the disease and management.","10.1016/j.jemermed.2016.03.033","Animals; Culicidae; Diagnosis, Differential; Education, Medical, Continuing; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Insect Vectors; United States; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes; Zika virus; blood; flavivirus; microcephaly; mosquito","Journal Article"

This report provides an update to the epidemiology of and public health response to ongoing Zika virus transmission in Puerto Rico. During November 1, 2015-April 14, 2016, a total of 6,157 specimens from suspected Zika virus-infected patients were evaluated by the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) and CDC Dengue Branch (which is located in San Juan, Puerto Rico), and 683 (11%) had laboratory evidence of current or recent Zika virus infection by one or more tests: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Zika virus-infected patients resided in 50 (64%) of 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico. Median age was 34 years (range = 35 days-89 years). The most frequently reported signs and symptoms were rash (74%), myalgia (68%), headache (63%), fever (63%), and arthralgia (63%).

29770012,"Canadian recommendations on the prevention and treatment of Zika virus: Update.","","Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada",2016,"BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as a disease of significant public health concern. Currently, a large outbreak is occurring predominantly located in the Americas. ZIKV infection is a cause of microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities and can cause post-infectious neurologic complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To review current knowledge of ZIKV infection and to provide guidance to health care professionals who provide advice to Canadians who may be impacted by ZIKV infection. METHODS: This Statement was developed by a working group of the Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT). Recommendations are based on a literature review and clinical judgment. RESULTS: All travellers should use personal protective measures against mosquito bites including insect repellents and protection of living areas against mosquito entry. Pregnant women should avoid travel to areas designated by the Public Health Agency of Canada as being of concern because of ongoing ZIKV transmission. Women planning a pregnancy should consult with their health care provider and consider postponing travel to these areas. All other travellers may wish to consider deferring travel to designated areas based on risk tolerance, values, and preferences.​: Sexual transmission of ZIKV from male partners has been documented and couples should practise abstinence or use condoms for the duration of a pregnancy, while in a risk area, or until viral shedding has likely ceased. In the absence of clear data, we make the assumption that viral shedding is unlikely to persist beyond 6 months for men and two months for non-pregnant women.​: Health care providers should take a travel history from their pregnant patients including relevant information related to the travel history of their partner(s). Screening and management recommendations are provided for all travellers including potentially contagious male partners, pregnant women (symptomatic and asymptomatic), and the fetus or infant of potentially infected women. There is no specific antiviral therapy for the treatment of ZIKV infection. CONCLUSION: Robust quantitative assessments for the full spectrum of ZIKV-associated risks are not possible. This reflects, among other things, uncertainties related to the likelihood of infection among travellers to ZIKV-affected areas, vertical transmission from mother to fetus, sexual transmission (from symptomatic or asymptomatic partners), and serious ZIKV-associated sequelae among travellers. Given this uncertainty, as well as the potentially severe effects of ZIKV infection on the fetus, recommendations are conservative. CATMAT will update its recommendations as new information becomes available.","10.14745/ccdr.v42i05a01","","","Journal Article"

By the end of February, the CDC had confirmed 147 Zika cases in U.S. residents who had traveled to Zika-endemic areas. While symptoms of Zika tend to be mild, the virus has been linked to serious birth defects, so public health efforts are focused primarily at mitigating the risk Zika poses to pregnant women. By mid-February, nine pregnant women who had traveled to Zika-endemic areas and contracted the virus had been reported to the CDC. Of these, four pregnancies ended in miscarriage or termination, and one child was born with microcephaly. While Zika is transmitted primarily via mosquito bites, the CDC is investigating more than a dozen reported cases of Zika transmitted via sexual contact. Public health authorities say Zika can trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome in a small number of infections. For frontline clinicians, travel history is key to identifying potential cases of Zika in pregnant women who may have been exposed.

Data sources were from peer review articles and WHO documents. The sources of Zika virus infection would include patients, people with asymptomatic infections and primates. The infectious period of Zika virus remains unclear. However, according to the period that RNA of Zika virus can be positively detected in blood, saliva, urine or semen, we can presume that the communicable period may last for 2 months or even longer.

However, increasing evidence supports a link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes (1), and a possible association between recent Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome has been reported (2). Although Zika virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of Aedes species of mosquitoes, sexual transmission also has been documented (3). Zika virus RNA has been detected in a number of body fluids, including blood, urine, saliva, and amniotic fluid (3-5), and whereas transmission associated with occupational exposure to these body fluids is theoretically possible, it has not been documented. Although there are no reports of transmission of Zika virus from infected patients to health care personnel or other patients, minimizing exposures to body fluids is important to reduce the possibility of such transmission. CDC recommends Standard Precautions in all health care settings to protect both health care personnel and patients from infection with Zika virus as well as from blood-borne pathogens (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and hepatitis C virus [HCV]) (6). Because of the potential for exposure to large volumes of body fluids during the labor and delivery process and the sometimes unpredictable and fast-paced nature of obstetrical care, the use of Standard Precautions in these settings is essential to prevent possible transmission of Zika virus from patients to health care personnel.","10.15585/mmwr.mm6511e3","Delivery of Health Care; Delivery, Obstetric; Education, Medical, Continuing; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Occupational Diseases; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Teaching; United States; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article"
26969497,"The Convergence of a Virus, Mosquitoes, and Human Travel in Globalizing the Zika Epidemic.","Imperato PJ","Journal of community health",2016,"The Zika virus was first identified in 1947 in the Zika Forest of Uganda. It was discovered in a rhesus monkey that had been placed in a cage on a sentinel platform in the forest by the Virus Research Institute. When this writer visited the institute and the Zika Forest in 1961, work was underway to identify mosquito species at various levels of the tree canopy. This was done through the placement of traps at various levels of a 120-foot-high steel tower which this writer climbed. At that time, researchers isolated 12 strains of Zika virus from traps on the tower. Over the next six decades, the virus spread slowly to other parts of Africa, and eventually appeared in Southeast Asia, transmitted by Aedes aegypti and other Aedes mosquito species. By 1981, only 14 cases of illness had been reported as due to the Zika virus. Since most infections with this virus are either mild or asymptomatic, its true geographic spread was not fully appreciated. The current globalization of the Zika epidemic began on the Pacific island of Yap in the Federated States of Polynesia in 2007. This was the first known presence of the Zika virus outside of Africa and Southeast Asia. It was estimated that 73 % of the island's population had been infected. In 2013, the virus spread to French Polynesia where an estimated 28,000 cases occurred in a population of 270,000. During that year and afterwards, microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities were observed in the infants of women who were pregnant when they contracted the virus. It is currently not known if cases of microcephaly have resulted from infection of pregnant women or from infection plus some other co-factor. The epidemic rapidly spread to the Cook Islands and Easter Island. In 2015, Zika virus infection was diagnosed in Brazil where it was associated with microcephaly in the infants of some women who were pregnant when they contracted the disease. Cases of the Guillain-Barré syndrome were also found to be associated with Zika virus infection. How the disease entered Brazil is a matter of conjecture. However, the strain responsible for the epidemic in Brazil and elsewhere in South and Central America is phylogenetically identical to that which caused the epidemic in French Polynesia. The wide distribution of Aedes aegypti, a principal vector of the virus, and other Aedes species has greatly facilitated the spread of the disease. Aedes aegypti is an invasive species of mosquito in the Western Hemisphere that has adapted well to densely-populated urban environments. In addition, male-to-female human sexual transmission has increasingly been demonstrated in the US and elsewhere. In February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current Zika outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern. On the recommendation of its Emergency Committee on Zika Virus and Observed Increase in Neurological Disorders and Neonatal Malformations, WHO issued a group of recommendations to contain the epidemic. The globalization of the Zika virus was made possible by the widespread presence in various parts of the world of Aedes vectors and increased human travel that facilitated geographic spread. This globalization of Zika follows upon that of West Nile, Ebola, Dengue, and Chikungunya. Its ultimate spread is difficult to predict, but will hopefully be restricted through vigorous preventive measures.","10.1007/s10900-016-0177-7","Aedes; Animals; Epidemics; Global Health; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Mosquito Vectors; Travel; Uganda; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes aegypti; Guillain-Barré syndrome; Kisubi Catholic Mission; Microcephaly; Zika Forest and Pascal James Imperato; Zika virus; Zika virus and travel; Zika virus infection","Historical Article; Journal Article; Review"

This virus was first identified in 1947, when it was isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey placed by British scientists working at the Yellow Fever Research Laboratory located in the Zika forest area of Uganda, hence its name, and is transmitted primarily by the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The fact that the rhesus macaque is an Asian species being placed in an African forest brings to mind the possibility of rapid adaptation of the virus from an African to Asian species, an issue that has not been considered. Whether such adaptation has played any role in acquiring pathogenicity due to cross species transmission remains to be identified. The first human infection was described in Nigeria in 1954, with only scattered reports of about a dozen human infections identified over a 50-year period. It was not until 2007 that Zika virus raised its ugly head with infections noted in three-quarters of the population on the tiny island of Yap located between the Philippines and Papua New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean, followed by a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013. The virus remained confined to a narrow equatorial band in Africa and Asia until 2014 when it began to spread eastward, first toward Oceania and then to South America. Since then, millions of infected individuals have been identified in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, including 25 additional countries in the Americas. While the symptoms associated with Zika virus infection are generally mild, consisting of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, there have been reports of more severe reactions that are associated with neurological complications. In pregnant women, fetal neurological complications include brain damage and microcephaly, while in adults there have been several cases of virus-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome. The virus was until recently believed to only be transmitted via mosquitoes. But when the Zika virus was isolated from the semen specimens from a patient in Texas, this provided the basis for the recent report of possible sexual transmission of the Zika virus. Due to the neurological complications, various vectors for infection as well as the rapid spread throughout the globe, it has prompted the World Health Organization to issue a global health emergency. Various governmental organizations have recommended that pregnant women do not travel to countries where the virus is epidemic, and within the countries affected by the virus, recommendations were provided for women of childbearing age to delay pregnancy. The overall public health impact of these above findings highlights the need for a rapid but specific diagnostic test for blood banks worldwide to identify those infected and for the counseling of women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy. As of this date, there are neither commercially licensed diagnostic tests nor a vaccine. Because cross-reactivity of the Zika virus with dengue and Chikungunya virus is common, it may pose difficulty in being able to quickly develop such tests and vaccines. So far the most effective public health measures include controlling the mosquito populations via insecticides and preventing humans from direct exposure to mosquitoes.","10.1016/j.jaut.2016.02.006","Animals; Communicable Disease Control; Disease Management; Disease Outbreaks; Global Health; History, 21st Century; Humans; Population Surveillance; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes aegypti; Arborvirus; Autophagy; Centrosome; Dengue; Flavivirus; Glycosylation; Guillain-Barre; Microcephaly; Mosquitoes; Pandemic; Sexual transmission; Zika fever","Historical Article; Journal Article"

Here we aimed to enlarge the spectrum of SACS mutations outside Quebec, to establish the pathogenicity of novel variants, and to expand the clinical and imaging phenotype. METHODS: Sequencing of SACS in 22 patients with unexplained early-onset ataxia, assessment of novel SACS variants in 3.500 European control chromosomes and extensive phenotypic investigations of all SACS carriers. RESULTS: We identified 11 index patients harbouring 17 novel SACS variants. 9/11 patients harboured two variants of at least probable pathogenicity which were not observed in controls and, in case of missense mutations, were located in highly conserved domains. These 9 patients accounted for at least 11% (9/83) in our series of unexplained early onset ataxia subjects. While most patients (7/9) showed the classical ARSACS triad, the presenting phenotype reached from pure neuropathy (leading to the initial diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) in one subject to the absence of any signs of neuropathy in another. In contrast to its name ""spastic ataxia"", neither spasticity (absent in 2/9=22%) nor extensor plantar response (absent in 3/9=33%) nor cerebellar ataxia (absent in 1/9=11%) were obligate features. Autonomic features included urine urge incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Apart from the well-established MRI finding of pontine hypointensities, all patients (100%) showed hyperintensities of the lateral pons merging into the (thickened) middle cerebellar peduncles. In addition, 63% exhibited bilateral parietal cerebral atrophy, and 63% a short circumscribed thinning of the posterior midbody of the corpus callosum.

CONCLUSIONS: We here demonstrate that each feature of the classical ARSACS triad (cerebellar ataxia, spasticity and peripheral neuropathy) might be missing in ARSACS.

The disease is most commonly caused by a point mutation within the TTR gene inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Over 100 of such mutations have been identified, leading to destabilization of the physiological TTR tetramer. As a result, many monomers originate with a tendency for spontaneous conformational changes and self-aggregation. The main clinical feature of TTR-FAP is progressive sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. In the beginning, this polyneuropathy predominantly involves small unmyelinated nerve fibers with the result of dissociated sensory loss disproportionately affecting sensation of pain and temperature. Autonomic neuropathy typically accompanies sensory deficits early in the disease course. The symptoms include orthostatic hypotension, constipation alternating with diarrhea, erectile dysfunction, anhydrosis, and urinary retention or incontinence. Later, involvement of motor fibers causes rapidly progressive weakness and gait disturbances. In addition to the peripheral nervous system, the heart and the gut are frequently affected. Onset of symptoms is bimodal, with one peak at age 33 years (early onset) and another distinct peak in the sixth decade of life (late onset). The course of TTR-FAP is uniformly progressive and fatal. Death occurs an average of 10.8 years after the onset of symptoms in Portuguese patients, and 7.3 years in late-onset Japanese patients. Common causes include cachexia, cardiac failure, arrhythmia, and secondary infections. Liver transplantation is the standard therapy for patients who are in a clinical condition good enough to tolerate this intervention because it stops progression of neuropathy by removing the main source of mutant TTR. Recently, orally administered tafamidis meglumine has been approved by European authorities for treatment of FAP. The substance has been shown to stabilize the TTR tetramer, thereby improving the outcome of patients with TTR-FAP. Various other strategies have been studied in vitro to prevent TTR amyloidosis, including gene therapy, immunization, dissolution of TTR aggregates, and free radical scavengers, but none of them is ready for clinical use so far.","10.2147/TACG.S19903","","FAP; amyloidosis; therapy; transthyretin; treatment","Journal Article"

The clinical picture of the proband was dominated by symptoms of autonomous polyneuropathy (orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, diarrhea, tachycardia, foot dyshydrosis) and of somatic nerve lesions (dumbness, impaired surface and deep sensitivity in the limbs). The patient presented with vitreous body opacity, disturbed eye movements, lateralized sensory symptoms, and difficulty of speech (baryphonia). Electromyographic quantitative autonomous testing and measurement of evoked sympathetic skin potentials confirmed affection of peripheral nerves. Heart ultrasound revealed restrictive amyloid cardiopathy. Histological analysis showed amyloid deposition in the intestines and sural nerve. The proband, his daughter, brother (monozygous twin), and brother's daughter had mutant TTR Cys 114 gene. The brother also had amyloid deposits in the absence of clinical signs of the disease. Analysis of familial medical history demonstrated autosomal dominant inheritance of this mutation in 4 generations.

2423668,"Childhood common variable immunodeficiency with autoimmune disease.","Conley ME; Park CL; Douglas SD","The Journal of pediatrics",1986,"Clinical and laboratory findings in eight patients with childhood common variable immunodeficiency and autoimmune disease are described. Six of the eight patients had initial signs of the disease, persistent secretory diarrhea, recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, or both, in the first year of life. Autoimmune manifestations included idiopathic thrombocytopenia (4/8), hemolytic anemia (3/8), secretory diarrhea (4/8), arthritis (2/8), chronic active hepatitis (2/8), parotitis (2/8), and Guillain-Barré syndrome (2/8). In addition to the expected sinusitis, otitis, and pneumonia caused by encapsulated bacteria, these patients also had severe infections with viruses of the herpes group. Most of these patients had lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, growth failure, and failure to develop secondary sexual characteristics. Laboratory studies demonstrated a significant increase in the ratio of T cells expressing the T helper phenotype (OKT4) to T cells expressing the T suppressor-cytotoxic phenotype (OKT8) (T4/T8). This increase could be attributed to a decrease in the absolute number of T8 cells. Additional findings included fluctuating levels of serum immunoglobulins and markedly diminished in vitro antibody production by B cells. The clinical course was relapsing and remitting, and dominated by the autoimmune manifestations of the disease. This group of patients constitutes a distinct subset of children with hypogammaglobulinemia, a subset with a complex, multisystemic disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality.","10.1016/s0022-3476(86)80927-1","Adolescent; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Autoimmune Diseases; Bacterial Infections; Child; Diarrhea; Female; Growth Disorders; Herpesviridae Infections; Humans; Immunoglobulins; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Immunologic Techniques; Male; Respiratory Tract Infections; Sex Characteristics; T-Lymphocytes; gamma-Globulins","","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

We followed 4.4 million Danes, including 9,615 same-sex married (SSM) persons, for 47 autoimmune diseases in the National Patient Registry between 1989 and 2008. Poisson regression analyses provided first hospitalization rate ratios (RRs) comparing rates between SSM individuals and persons in other marital status categories. SSM individuals experienced no unusual overall risk of autoimmune diseases. However, the risk of autoimmune thyroid dysfunction was increased, notably Hashimoto's thyroiditis (women(SSM), RR = 2.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74-4.55) and Graves' disease (men(SSM), RR = 1.88; 95% CI 1.08-3.01). There was also an excess of primary biliary cirrhosis (women(SSM), RR = 4.09; 95% CI 1.01-10.7), and of psoriasis (men(SSM), RR = 2.48; 95% CI 1.77-3.36), rheumatic fever (men(SSM), RR = 7.55; 95% CI 1.87-19.8), myasthenia gravis (men(SSM), RR = 5.51; 95% CI 1.36-14.4), localized scleroderma (men(SSM), RR = 7.16; 95% CI 1.18-22.6) and pemphigoid (men(SSM), RR = 6.56; 95% CI 1.08-20.6), while Dupuytren's contracture was reduced (men(SSM), RR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.39-0.99). The excess of psoriasis was restricted to same-sex married men with HIV/AIDS (men(SSM), RR = 10.5; 95% CI 6.44-15.9), whereas Graves' disease occurred in excess only among same-sex married men without HIV/AIDS (men(SSM), RR = 1.99; 95% CI 1.12-3.22). Lesbians and immunologically competent gay men in same-sex marriage face no unusual overall risk of autoimmune diseases. However, the observed increased risk of thyroid dysfunction in these lesbians and gay men deserves further study.","10.1007/s10654-013-9869-9","Adolescent; Adult; Autoimmune Diseases; Cohort Studies; Confidence Intervals; Denmark; Female; Graves Disease; Homosexuality; Humans; Male; Marital Status; Marriage; Registries; Regression Analysis; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors; Thyroiditis, Autoimmune; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 15,357 adult health maintenance organization members enrolled in the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Study from 1995 to 1997 in San Diego, California, and eligible for follow-up through 2005. ACEs included childhood physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; witnessing domestic violence; growing up with household substance abuse, mental illness, parental divorce, and/or an incarcerated household member. The total number of ACEs (ACE Score range = 0-8) was used as a measure of cumulative childhood stress. The outcome was hospitalizations for any of 21 selected autoimmune diseases and 4 immunopathology groupings: T- helper 1 (Th1) (e.g., idiopathic myocarditis); T-helper 2 (Th2) (e.g., myasthenia gravis); Th2 rheumatic (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis); and mixed Th1/Th2 (e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia). RESULTS: Sixty-four percent reported at least one ACE. The event rate (per 10,000 person-years) for a first hospitalization with any autoimmune disease was 31.4 in women and 34.4 in men. First hospitalizations for any autoimmune disease increased with increasing number of ACEs (p < .05). Compared with persons with no ACEs, persons with >or=2 ACEs were at a 70% increased risk for hospitalizations with Th1, 80% increased risk for Th2, and 100% increased risk for rheumatic diseases (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood traumatic stress increased the likelihood of hospitalization with a diagnosed autoimmune disease decades into adulthood. These findings are consistent with recent biological studies on the impact of early life stress on subsequent inflammatory responses.","10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181907888","Adult; Adult Children; Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune; Autoimmune Diseases; California; Child; Child Abuse; Cohort Studies; Disease Susceptibility; Divorce; Domestic Violence; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Inflammation; Lymphokines; Male; Middle Aged; Myocarditis; Rheumatic Diseases; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Th1 Cells; Th2 Cells","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

Agents that can induce or maintain the opening of K(+) channels also offer a therapeutic approach to controlling of cell excitability and offer a means of producing stability in biological systems. The pathogenesis of a broad range of peripheral disorders (e.g., LQT syndrome, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, hyperinsulinism in infancy and erectile dysfunction) are associated with dysfunctional K(+) channels due to mutations in genes encoding channel proteins. The therapeutic potential of KCOs in peripheral K(+) channelopathies is discussed. The identification of K(+) channel subtype-specific openers offers discrete modulation of cellular systems creating a realistic therapeutic advance in the treatment of K(+) channelopathies.","10.1517/13543784.10.7.1345","Adenosine Triphosphatases; Drugs, Investigational; Ion Channel Gating; Potassium Channels","","Journal Article; Review"
