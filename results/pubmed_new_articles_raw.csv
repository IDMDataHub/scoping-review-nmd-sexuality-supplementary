"39636620","Real-world safety evaluation of atorvastatin: insights from the US FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS).","Wan H; Xu X; Yi D; Shuai K","Expert opinion on drug safety","2025","OBJECTIVE: Given the extensive use of atorvastatin in managing cardiovascular conditions and the surge in reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs), this study leverages the FAERS database to comprehensively evaluate atorvastatin-associated adverse events, thereby enhancing our understanding of its safety profile in real-world settings. METHODS: A retrospective observational pharmacovigilance study was conducted using FAERS data from Q1 2004 to Q1 2024. Four algorithms - ROR, PRR, BCPNN, and EBGM - were employed to detect signals of adverse events (AEs) linked to atorvastatin through disproportionality analysis. RESULTS: Out of 17,627,340 reports in the FAERS database 81,955 involved atorvastatin. Consistently identified AEs across all four algorithms included musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, metabolic and nutritional disorders, and hepatobiliary disorders at the system organ class (SOC) level. A total of 4,575 significant disproportionate preferred terms (PTs) were observed across 23 SOCs, with key PTs being 'immune-mediated myositis,' 'type 2 diabetes mellitus,' 'necrotizing myositis,' 'autoimmune myositis,' and 'myopathy.' Additionally, unexpected AEs such as erectile dysfunction were identified. The median onset time for these AEs was 60 days, with most occurring within the first 30 days of treatment. CONCLUSION: This study identified both expected and unexpected AEs associated with atorvastatin, highlighting the need for continued surveillance and providing valuable insights for clinicians to optimize atorvastatin use and address safety concerns.","10.1080/14740338.2024.2424438","Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Humans; Atorvastatin; Pharmacovigilance; Retrospective Studies; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Female; Databases, Factual; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Young Adult; Adolescent; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions","Atorvastatin; FAERS; Statins; adverse event; pharmacovigilance","Journal Article; Observational Study"
"39325119","Methotrexate: Use in the Post Dobbs v. Jackson Era.","Huddleston EM; Saag KG","Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases","2024","Methotrexate is one of the most frequently used medications for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Although initially developed for use as chemotherapy for both solid and hematologic malignancies, it was used as early as the 1960s with success for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis, ultimately being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of RA in 1988. Beyond RA and psoriatic arthritis, methotrexate is used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and other inflammatory conditions. Methotrexate is cytotoxic to the trophoblast and has been used to treat both ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, leading to studies in the early 1990s that showed it was effective and safe for early abortion in combination with prostaglandin E1 analog misoprostol. Methotrexate is also a teratogen, causing serious birth defects in 6%-10% of patients taking it while pregnant. Additionally, women are more likely to be affected by both RA at SLE, as compared with males, thus worsening the burden of these adverse effects. Both methotrexate's history of use as an abortifacient and its teratogenic properties make its use more complicated in the current era of abortion policy in the United States following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling. Recently published data suggest that this ruling has affected both provider perspectives and patient experiences as it relates to methotrexate use. In the post-Dobbs era, the role of the rheumatologist as it relates to patients' sexual and reproductive health is likely to expand.","10.1097/RHU.0000000000002130","Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Abortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidal; Abortion, Induced; Antirheumatic Agents; History, 20th Century; Methotrexate; Rheumatic Diseases; United States","","Journal Article; Review"

Herein, we present a case of a 10-year-old girl with Down's syndrome, short stature, and vitiligo who presented to our hospital with vaginal bleeding and a palpable pelvic mass. Upon ultrasound and topographical examination, bilateral ovarian masses with negative tumor markers were detected. After bilateral gonadectomy, endocrine studies revealed profound hypothyroidism and peripheral puberty that led to the VWGS syndrome diagnosis (TSH 367.3 mUI/mL, isolated menstruation, indetectable LH, and elevated estradiol). Levothyroxine treatment improved obesity and short stature, and sexual hormone replacement began at 13 years of age. The literature on Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome shows that it presents most often in women, and classic hypothyroidism symptoms always precede the diagnosis. Approximately 11% of patients have Down's syndrome, sometimes tumor markers are elevated, and some develop severe symptoms (myopathy, short stature, mental delay, ascites, pericardial effusion, Cullen's sign, pituitary hyperplasia, and severe anemia) that respond to levothyroxine treatment.

Gross anatomical dissection of the cadaveric body revealed extensive herniation of portions of the small intestine and peritoneal sac along the costal margin and extending to the left aspect of the abdomen. Additionally, an uncircumcised phallus was buried within the suprapubic fat pad and demonstrated simple, grade III penoscrotal webbing (PSW), creating an impression of micropenis presence. To gain additional insights into the current case, analysis of the coding regions (exomes) of DNA procured from the body for putative genetic variants was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. This analysis revealed 110 rare (minor allele frequency (MAF) ≤ 0.01), pathologic/deleterious genetic mutations. The most relevant variants to this case were the ones associated with male sexual development, BMP1 and BMP4; connective tissue development, COL3A1 and COL5A3; cilia morphogenesis and function, DNAH5 and MAPK15; as well as hormonal homeostasis, ESR1. Direct involvement of BMP1 both in male sexual development and hernia genesis makes it a strong candidate for linking the two pathologies, PSW and multiple hernias, observed in the present case. Yet the presence of a group of mutated genes linked to myopathies (ITGA7, NRAP, POLM, SCN5A, XIRP2) and muscular dystrophy (ITGA7) raises a question about the involvement of these muscular pathologies in hernia genesis and unsuccessful hernia repairs associated with the current case.","10.7759/cureus.47375","","anatomical variation; genetic screen; hernias; muscular pathologies; penoscrotal webbing; wound healing","Case Reports; Journal Article"

However, no specific treatment has been proposed to date. To our knowledge, this is the first (pilot) study aiming to investigate the effect of an 8-week tailored physiotherapy program on the sexual health of women with SSc and IIM. METHODS: In total, 12 women with SSc and 4 women with IIM were enrolled in the study. Based on the patients' capability to participate in the program, they were divided into an intervention group (IG) (mean ± SD age 46.8 ± 8.6 years) and a control group (CG) (mean ± SD age 46.3 ± 8.5 years). IG underwent the 8-week program (1 h of supervised physiotherapy twice weekly), whereas CG received no physiotherapy. At weeks 0 and 8, all patients filled in questionnaires assessing sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI], Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women [BISF-W]), sexual quality of life (Sexual Quality of Life-Female [SQoL-F]), functional ability (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]), quality of life (Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 [SF-36]), and depression (Beck's Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]). The changes were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Friedmann's test. RESULTS: Compared to the statistically significant deterioration in CG over weeks 0-8, we found statistically significant improvements in the total scores of FSFI and BISF-W, and some of their domains, functional status, and the physical component of quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our 8-week physiotherapy program not only prevented the natural course of progressive deterioration of functional ability but also led to a significant improvement in sexual function and quality of life in women with SSc and IIM. However, due to the lack of randomization and a relatively small sample size resulting from the strict inclusion criteria, further validation of our results is needed.

"36966027","Review: Current challenges in poultry nutrition, health, and welfare.","Korver DR","Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience","2023","The poultry industry has benefited greatly from advances in genetics, nutrition, housing and management strategies. Geneticists have made welfare and health traits important components of selection programs, and in general, modern, high-producing poultry are healthier than 30 years ago. However, increased productivity means that the birds are closer to their physiological limits, and nutrition, environment and management have become increasingly important. The move away from in-feed antibiotic growth promotors has resulted in challenges in maintaining gut health and consequently, bird performance. However, as the industry adapts to production without the use of antibiotic growth promotors, long-term benefits may be realized due to a reduction in antimicrobial resistance. Intensive selection for meat yield and efficiency are associated with an increased risk of muscle myopathies that affect bird health and meat quality. As genetic selection increased broiler production traits, it became necessary to restrict parent stock nutrient intake in order to prevent excessive muscle and fat deposition, reduce metabolic disease, and maintain ovarian control. With continued selection for broiler production traits, the degree of restriction implemented has become a welfare issue. Additionally, recent research suggests that highly efficient broiler lines may have limited fat deposition and therefore energy reserves to support sexual maturation and egg production, especially if typical broiler breeder BW targets are maintained. A re-examination of broiler breeder feeding programs is necessary to maintain productivity and welfare. Modern laying hens are capable of laying cycles in excess of 100 weeks of age. This has reduced the use of stress-inducing forced molting programs and reduces the total number of hens needed to meet the demand for egg production. The important role of the skeletal system in eggshell deposition demands that skeletal development during rearing be carefully managed to avoid shell and skeletal problems at the end of the production cycle. As the production potential of modern poultry continues to increase through genetic and genomic selection, even greater care must be paid in order to maintain bird health and welfare. The poultry industry has successfully faced many challenges in the past and is likely to overcome the existing challenges as well.","10.1016/j.animal.2023.100755","Animals; Female; Poultry; Chickens; Ovum; Nutritional Status; Eating","Broiler chicken; Challenges and opportunities; Laying hen; Metabolic limits; Production efficiency","Journal Article; Review"

Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is one of the 11 members of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) family that specifically targets cGMP generated by nitric oxide-driven activation of the soluble guanylyl cyclase. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil and tadalafil, are widely used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and certain urological disorders. Preclinical studies have shown promising effects of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, cancer and anticancer-drug-associated cardiotoxicity, diabetes, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, and other aging-related conditions. Many clinical trials with PDE5 inhibitors have focused on the potential cardiovascular, anticancer, and neurological benefits.

"34251644","Role of L-Arginine in Nitric Oxide Synthesis and Health in Humans.","Wu G; Meininger CJ; McNeal CJ; Bazer FW; Rhoads JM","Advances in experimental medicine and biology","2021","As a functional amino acid (AA), L-arginine (Arg) serves not only as a building block of protein but also as an essential substrate for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), creatine, polyamines, homoarginine, and agmatine in mammals (including humans). NO (a major vasodilator) increases blood flow to tissues. Arg and its metabolites play important roles in metabolism and physiology. Arg is required to maintain the urea cycle in the active state to detoxify ammonia. This AA also activates cellular mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) and focal adhesion kinase cell signaling pathways in mammals, thereby stimulating protein synthesis, inhibiting autophagy and proteolysis, enhancing cell migration and wound healing, promoting spermatogenesis and sperm quality, improving conceptus survival and growth, and augmenting the production of milk proteins. Although Arg is formed de novo from glutamine/glutamate and proline in humans, these synthetic pathways do not provide sufficient Arg in infants or adults. Thus, humans and other animals do have dietary needs of Arg for optimal growth, development, lactation, and fertility. Much evidence shows that oral administration of Arg within the physiological range can confer health benefits to both men and women by increasing NO synthesis and thus blood flow in tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle and the corpora cavernosa of the penis). NO is a vasodilator, a neurotransmitter, a regulator of nutrient metabolism, and a killer of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses [including coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19). Thus, Arg supplementation can enhance immunity, anti-infectious, and anti-oxidative responses, fertility, wound healing, ammonia detoxification, nutrient digestion and absorption, lean tissue mass, and brown adipose tissue development; ameliorate metabolic syndromes (including dyslipidemia, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension); and treat individuals with erectile dysfunction, sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and pre-eclampsia.","10.1007/978-3-030-74180-8_10","Animals; Arginine; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Nitric Oxide; Pregnancy; Protein Biosynthesis; SARS-CoV-2","Arginine; Blood flow; Disease; Health; Metabolism; Nitric oxide; Skeletal muscle","Journal Article"

Chromosome karyotype G-banding analysis of the proband showed a 46,XX karyotype, but B-ultrasound analysis demonstrated the existence of scrotum, testis and penis which inferred a male sexual differentiation. Aneuploidy and copy number variation (CNV) detection by low-coverage single-end whole genome sequencing (WGS) revealed a de novo SRY (sex-determining region Y) gene positive fragment of 224.34 kb length (chrY:2,649,472-2,873,810) which explained the gonadal/genital-chromosomal inconsistency in the proband. Additionally, targeted-region-capture-based DMD gene sequencing and Sanger verification confirmed a widely reported pathogenic heterozygous nonsense mutation (NM_004006, c.9100C>T, p.Arg3034Ter) in the dystrophin-coding gene named DMD. This study emphasizes that integrated analyses of the imaging results, cytogenetics, and molecular features can play an important role in prenatal diagnosis. It requires the combination of more detection techniques with higher resolution than karyotyping to determine the genetic and biological sex of fetuses in prenatal diagnosis. To conclusively determine both the biological and genetic sex of the fetus at the time of prenatal diagnosis particularly in cases that involve X-linked conditions is of vital importance, which would crucially influence the decision-making regarding abortions. This study will help in prenatal diagnosis of DMD in future, also providing a new perspective that enables the genetic diagnosis of sex reversal in pregnancy. Moreover, genetic counseling/analysis for early diagnosis and pre-symptom interventions are warranted.","10.3389/fgene.2019.01350","","46,XX testicular DSD; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; genetic counseling; integrated analyses; prenatal","Case Reports; Journal Article"

Here, we have described a novel 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis syndrome caused by homozygous variants in PPP2R3C gene. This gene encodes B″gamma regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the phospho-regulation processes of most mammalian cell types. PPP2R3C gene is most abundantly expressed in testis in humans, while its function was hitherto unknown. Patients and methods Four girls from four unrelated families with 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis were studied using exome or Sanger sequencing of PPP2R3C gene. In total, four patients and their heterozygous parents were investigated for clinical, laboratory, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics. Results We have identified three different homozygous PPP2R3C variants, c.308T>C (p.L103P), c.578T>C (p.L193S) and c.1049T>C (p.F350S), in four girls with 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis. Patients also manifested a unique syndrome of extragonadal anomalies, including typical facial gestalt, low birth weight, myopathy, rod and cone dystrophy, anal atresia, omphalocele, sensorineural hearing loss, dry and scaly skin, skeletal abnormalities, renal agenesis and neuromotor delay. We have shown a decreased SOX9-Phospho protein expression in the dysgenetic gonads of the patients with homozygous PPP2R3C variants suggesting impaired SOX9 signaling in the pathogenesis of gonadal dysgenesis. Heterozygous males presented with abnormal sperm morphology and impaired fertility. Conclusion Our findings suggest that PPP2R3C protein is involved in the ontogeny of multiple organs, especially critical for testis development and spermatogenesis.

Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are vasodilating drugs established in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and pulmonary hypertension. We reviewed published data on the effects of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors on CBF in adult humans. A systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Embase, Medline and Cochrane Library Trials databases were searched. Sixteen studies with 353 participants in total were retrieved. Studies included healthy volunteers and patients with migraine, ED, type 2 diabetes, stroke, pulmonary hypertension, Becker muscular dystrophy and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Most studies used middle cerebral artery flow velocity to estimate CBF. Few studies employed direct measurements of tissue perfusion. Resting CBF velocity was unaffected by phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, but cerebrovascular regulation was improved in ED, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, Becker's and a group of healthy volunteers. This evidence suggests that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors improve responsiveness of the cerebral vasculature, particularly in disease states associated with an impaired endothelial dilatory response. This supports the potential therapeutic use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors in vascular cognitive impairment where CBF is reduced. Further studies with better resolution of deep CBF are warranted.

The syndrome is associated with increased mortality and impaired quality of life because of the occurrence of comorbidities. These clinical complications include metabolic syndrome, consisting of systemic arterial hypertension, visceral obesity, impairment of glucose metabolism, and dyslipidaemia; musculoskeletal disorders, such as myopathy, osteoporosis, and skeletal fractures; neuropsychiatric disorders, such as impairment of cognitive function, depression, or mania; impairment of reproductive and sexual function; and dermatological manifestations, mainly represented by acne, hirsutism, and alopecia. Hypertension in patients with Cushing's syndrome has a multifactorial pathogenesis and contributes to the increased risk for myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, or stroke, which are the most common causes of death; risks of these outcomes are exacerbated by a prothrombotic diathesis and hypokalaemia. Neuropsychiatric disorders can be responsible for suicide. Immune disorders are common; immunosuppression during active disease causes susceptibility to infections, possibly complicated by sepsis, an important cause of death, whereas immune rebound after disease remission can exacerbate underlying autoimmune diseases. Prompt treatment of cortisol excess and specific treatments of comorbidities are crucial to prevent serious clinical complications and reduce the mortality associated with Cushing's syndrome.","10.1016/S2213-8587(16)00086-3","Cardiovascular Diseases; Cushing Syndrome; Humans; Immune System Diseases; Mental Disorders; Metabolic Syndrome; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological","","Journal Article; Review"

The most common cause of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability of the corporal tissue to store the blood within the corporal sinusoids once inflow into the corpora begins. This failure to store is primarily due to a corporal smooth muscle dysfunction and, in most men, is most likely an aging-related occurrence. Because the corporal smooth muscle is embryologically and physiologically indistinguishable from the smooth muscle within our arterial system, the authors hypothesize that the aging-related dysfunction that occurs within the penis also occurs within the arterial system, and that this smooth muscle dysfunction within the arterial media is most likely the cause of what is called essential hypertension. This panvascular smooth muscle myopathy could explain why hypertension is the most common comorbidity associated with ED and appears to indicate that both ED and essential hypertension are the same disorder, albeit in two different organ systems.",NA,"","Endothelium; Erection; Hypertension; Smooth muscle","Journal Article"

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the sexual function and the quality of sleep of caregiving mothers of sons with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). METHODS: We evaluated 20 caregiving mothers of sons with DMD and 20 caregiving mothers of sons without any neuromuscular or chronic disease. All of them voluntarily responded to the evaluating questionnaires about their sexuality and their quality of sleep, and gave blood samples to evaluate their hormonal levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All mothers were evaluated using the questionnaire of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Pittsburgh questionnaire (PSQI). The blood samples were tested to determine serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, progesterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol. RESULTS: Caregiving mothers of sons with DMD had significantly lower scores in the FSFI questionnaire, suggesting a higher risk for sexual dysfunction. The PSQI demonstrated that these caregiving mothers present increased sleep latency, reduced sleep efficiency, daytime dysfunction, and poor sleep quality. Blood tests showed a rise in cortisol levels, which correlated with the compromised sexuality and quality of sleep. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that caregiving mothers of sons with DMD show major risk for sexual dysfunction and a reduction in their quality of sleep mediated in part by the hormonal changes related to stress.

The characterization of its downstream signalling, mediated through stimulation of soluble GC (sGC) and cGMP generation, initiated significant translational interest, but until recently this was almost exclusively embodied by the use of PDE5 inhibitors in erectile dysfunction. Since then, research progress in two areas has contributed to an impressive expansion of the therapeutic targeting of the NO-sGC-cGMP axis: first, an increased understanding of the molecular events operating within this complex pathway and second, a better insight into its dys-regulation and uncoupling in human disease. Already-approved PDE5 inhibitors and novel, first-in-class molecules, which up-regulate the activity of sGC independently of NO and/or of the enzyme's haem prosthetic group, are undergoing clinical evaluation to treat pulmonary hypertension and myocardial failure.

"24607254","Dog as a model in studies on human hereditary diseases and their gene therapy.","Switonski M","Reproductive biology","2014","During the last 15 years spectacular progress has been achieved in knowledge on the dog genome organization and the molecular background of hereditary diseases in this species. A majority of canine genetic diseases have their counterparts in humans and thus dogs are considered as a very important large animal model in human biomedicine. Among canine monogenic diseases with known causative gene mutations there are two large groups classified as retinal dystrophies and lysosomal storage diseases. Specific types of these diseases are usually diagnosed in a single or several breeds. A well known disorder, restricted to a single breed, is congenital stationary night blindness described in Briards. This disease is a counterpart of Leber amaurosis in children. On the other hand, one of the most common monogenic human diseases (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), has its canine counterparts in several breeds (e.g., the Golden retriever, Beagle and German short-haired pointer). For some of the canine diseases gene therapy strategy was successfully applied, e.g., for congenital stationary night blindness, rod-cone dystrophy and muccopolysaccharydoses type I, IIIB and VII. Since phenotypic variability between the breeds is exceptionally high, the dog is an interesting model to study the molecular background of congenital malformations (e.g., dwarfism and osteoporosis imperfecta). Also disorders of sexual development (DSD), especially testicular or ovotesticular DSD (78,XX; SRY-negative), which is widely distributed across dozens of breeds, are of particular interest. Studies on the genetic background of canine cancers, a major health problem in this species, are also quite advanced. On the other hand, genetic studies on canine counterparts of major human complex diseases (e.g., obesity, the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus) are still in their infancy.","10.1016/j.repbio.2013.12.007","Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Dogs; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Genetic Therapy; Genome","Congenital malformation; Disorder of sexual development; Gene therapy; Lysosomal storage disease; Obesity; Retinal dystrophy","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

But they also possess several adverse effects like myopathy with elevation of hepatic transaminases (>3 times the upper limit of normal) or creatine kinase (>10 times the upper limit of normal) and some rare side-effects, including peripheral neuropathy, memory loss, sleep disturbances, and erectile dysfunction. Due to these adverse effects, patients abruptly withdrew statins without consulting physicians. This abrupt discontinuation of statins is termed as statin intolerance. Statin-induced myopathy constitutes two third of all side-effects from statins and is the primary reason for statin intolerance. Though statin intolerance has considerably impacted cardiovascular outcomes in the high-risk patients, it has been well effectively managed by prescribing statins either as alternate-day or once weekly dosage regimen, as combination therapy with a non-statin therapy or and by dietary intervention.

We applied a reproductive control program to a population of eastern grey kangaroos confined to a golf course in South East Queensland. The program aimed to reduce fecundity sufficiently for the population to decrease over time so that overgrazing of the fairways and the frequency of human-animal conflict situations were minimised. In 2003, 92% of the female kangaroos above 5 kg bodyweight were implanted with the GnRH agonist deslorelin after darting with a dissociative anaesthetic. In 2007, 86% of the females above 5 kg were implanted with deslorelin and also 87% of the males above 5 kg were sterilised by either orchidectomy or vasectomy. In 2005, 2008 and 2009, the population was censused to assess the effect of each treatment. The 2003 deslorelin program resulted in effective zero population growth for approximately 2.5 years. The combined deslorelin-surgery program in 2007 reduced the birth rate from 0.3 to 0.06%/year for 16 months, resulting in a 27% population reduction by November 2009. The results were consistent with implants conferring contraception to 100% of implanted females for at least 12 months. The iatrogenic mortality rates for each program were 10.5% and 4.9%, respectively, with 50% of all mortalities due to darting-related injuries, exertional myopathy/hyperthermia or recovery misadventure. The short term sexual and agonistic behaviour of the males was assessed for the 2007 program: no significant changes were seen in adult males given the vasectomy procedure, while sexual behaviours' were decreased in adult males given the orchidectomy procedure. It is concluded that female reproduction was effectively controlled by implantation with deslorrelin and male reproductive behaviour was reduced by orchidectomy, which together achieved population control.","10.3390/ani4030562","","Deslorelin; behaviour; orchidectomy; vasectomy; welfare","Journal Article"

This report provides the first documentation of uneventful octreotide LAR use during three pregnancies in a woman with bronchial carcinoid-associated adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent Cushing's syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old Arabic woman presented to our emergency department with rapid onset of headache, flaring acne and hirsutism, facial puffiness, weight gain and paroxysmal myopathy, and paranoiac thoughts of rape and sexual intimidation. After undergoing surgical removal of a mass by left lower lung lobectomy, her residual lung disease medical therapy failed. Chronic octreotide LAR injections were initiated as indicated by a positive octreoscan.Follow-up revealed a long-lasting positive response to octreotide. Avidity of octreotide to somatostatin receptor sub-type 2 was later confirmed by a positive somatostatin receptor sub-type 2 in the resected tumor specimen. Against our instructions, the patient had three spontaneous pregnancies leading to delivery of three full-term healthy children while her octreotide LAR therapy continued. CONCLUSION: This case adds more data supporting the potential for the safe use of octreotide and the feasibility of octreotide LAR use during pregnancy, making compliance with the patient's preference not to withdraw octreotide therapy as soon as her pregnancy is confirmed a thoughtful option.","10.1186/1752-1947-5-386","","","Journal Article"

However, recent operative series suggest low morbidity and mortality for CS, whereas population-based surveys report elevated mortality rates. We investigated the mortality and morbidity of CS in New Zealand. DESIGN: A nationwide retrospective survey of patients with CS between 1960 and 2005 managed at the four main endocrinology services. PATIENTS: A total of 253 patients with CS were identified, excluding adrenal carcinoma and malignant ectopic CS. MEASUREMENTS; The primary outcome was the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), comparing the observed number of deaths with the expected number for the population matched for age, sex and duration of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the change in prevalence of co-morbidities at presentation and at final follow-up. RESULTS: The approximate prevalence and incidence of CS was 79/million and 1·8/million/y. The mean age at presentation was 39 year, and median duration of follow-up was 6·4 year (range 0-46). Overall, 89% achieved biochemical cure at last follow-up, with >90% achieving biochemical cure for CS from adrenal adenoma and pituitary causes. Thirty-six patients died during follow-up compared with 8·8 expected deaths (SMR 4·1, 95%CI 2·9-5·6). While hypertension, sexual dysfunction, myopathy and mild psychiatric illness were significantly reduced after treatment, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, moderate or major psychiatric illness, and osteoporosis were common at final follow-up. CONCLUSION: CS is associated with both high mortality and a high prevalence of co-morbidities, even when biochemical cure rates are between 80% and 90%.","10.1111/j.1365-2265.2011.04124.x","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Cushing Syndrome; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

In cellular and animal models, androgen activated AR modulates myoblasts proliferation, promotes sexual dimorphic muscle development, and alters muscle fiber type. In the clinical setting, administration of anabolic androgens can decrease cachexia and speed wound healing. During myogenesis and regeneration of skeletal muscle in embryo and adult, the membrane of myoblasts fuse and the actin cytoskeleton is rearranged to form an alignment with myosin to form myotubes then ultimately the myofibrils. Contraction of skeletal muscle promotes the growth of myocytes by coordinating signals from the neuromuscular junction to intra-myofibrils through costameres, the functional structure comprised of signal proteins closely associated with actin filaments and involved in muscular dystrophy. Therefore, the discovery of actin-binding proteins functioning as AR coregulators implies that androgen signaling is tightly regulated during the process of the development and regeneration of skeletal muscle. The search for selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM) that act precisely in skeletal muscle instead of other tissues could target the engineering of a SARM-AR complex that selectively recruits these coregulators.","10.1016/j.jsbmb.2008.06.001","Actins; Androgens; Humans; Microfilament Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Receptors, Androgen; Signal Transduction","","Journal Article; Review"
"18257791","An exploratory study of parents' approaches to health promotion in families of adolescents with physical disabilities.","Antle BJ; Mills W; Steele C; Kalnins I; Rossen B","Child: care, health and development","2008","BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of children with physical disabilities now extends into adulthood and has been accompanied by the transfer of rehabilitation services from institutions to the home. Thus, families must increasingly partner with health service providers to promote their child's health and prevent the development of secondary conditions that may contribute to heart disease, stroke, respiratory diseases, low endurance and emotional difficulties. AIM: To investigate within a family context the health promotion efforts of parents on behalf of a child with a physical disability. METHOD: The Long Interview Method was used to interview 15 families (11 two-parent and 4 single-parent) having a child 11-16 years of age with a physical disability including cerebral palsy (7), spina bifida (3), muscular dystrophy (3) and other conditions (2). RESULTS: Parents' health promotion efforts were characterized by three main themes. First, parents emphasized traditional lifestyle health behaviours including nutrition, physical activity, tobacco, alcohol and drug use, and personal hygiene. Second, parents tried to foster their adolescent's social life and friendships. They expressed particular concern about how, and if, their child would develop a sense of purpose and have a productive future. Third, parents invested a great deal of effort into observing daily routines, making arrangements for their child's social inclusion and supporting their child in a way that balanced independence with safety and energy conservation. CONCLUSIONS: Parents recognize that their child with a physical disability faces greater obstacles, and work hard at health promotion. Healthcare workers need to work with parents to: (1) provide information about specific lifestyle health behaviours including nutrition, physical activity and sexuality; (2) advocate for resources to foster social inclusion; and (3) discuss family strategies that balance parental involvement with their child's need for independence and energy conservation for daily activities.","10.1111/j.1365-2214.2007.00782.x","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Children with Disabilities; Family; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Promotion; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Life Style; Male; Parent-Child Relations; Parenting; Parents; Surveys and Questionnaires","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Endocrinology and metabolism","2007","Epidemiological evidence suggests alcoholic myopathy is more severe in females than males, but comparable animal studies are lacking that make elucidating the biochemical locus for this defect problematic. The present study determined whether skeletal muscle protein synthesis and markers of degradation exhibit a sexual dimorphic response to either chronic alcohol consumption or acute intoxication. Male and female rats were fed an alcohol-containing diet, pair-fed for 26 wk (chronic), or received an intraperitoneal injection of alcohol (acute). In males, chronic alcohol decreased gastrocnemius protein synthesis by 20%. This reduction was associated with a twofold increase in the inactive eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E.4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) complex and a 60% reduction in the active eIF4E.eIF4G complex. This redistribution of eIF4E was associated with decreased phosphorylation of both 4E-BP1 and eIF4G (50-55%). The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 was also reduced 60% in alcohol-consuming male rats. In contrast, neither rates of protein synthesis nor indexes of translation initiation in muscle were altered in alcohol-fed female rats despite blood alcohol levels comparable to males. Chronic alcohol ingestion did not alter atrogin-1 or muscle RING finger-1 mRNA content (biomarkers of muscle proteolysis) in males but increased their expression in females 50-100%. Acute alcohol intoxication produced a comparable decrease in muscle protein synthesis and translation initiation in both male and female rats. Our data demonstrate a sexual dimorphism for muscle protein synthesis, translation initiation, and proteolysis in response to chronic, but not acute, alcohol intoxication; however, they do not support evidence indicating females are more sensitive toward the development of alcoholic skeletal muscle myopathy.","10.1152/ajpendo.00603.2006","Acute Disease; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholic Intoxication; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Ethanol; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G; Female; Hormones; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Muscle Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Peptide Hydrolases; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Biosynthesis; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Ribosomal Protein S6; Sex Characteristics; Time Factors","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

"9689743","Protozoan infections (Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum and Sarcocystis spp.) in sheep and goats: recent advances.","Buxton D","Veterinary research","1998","The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a serious cause of fetal mortality in sheep and goats. Oocysts, the parasite stage responsible for initiating infection, are produced following a primary infection in cats. A primary infection in pregnant sheep and goats can establish a placental and fetal infection which may result in fetal death and resorption, abortion or stillbirth. Diagnosis is aided by the clinical picture, the presence of characteristic small white necrotic foci in placental cotyledons, the possible presence of a mummified fetus and on fetal serology and histopathology. Development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for T. gondii may also provide a valuable diagnostic tool. Measures to control abortion include improved management of farm cats, fodder and water. Vaccination of sheep with the live vaccine is an effective preventive measure and the use of decoquinate in feed may be useful in some situations. Neospora caninum is related to T. gondii and while its asexual life cycle is similar to that of the latter it is currently not known whether it has a similar sexual life cycle in a definitive host. Neospora is an important cause of fetal loss in cattle and parallels that of T. gondii infection in sheep and goats. While it does not appear to cause frequent losses in these latter animals, experimental infection is readily induced in them and if initiated during pregnancy provides a very good model of the bovine infection. Furthermore clinical signs and pathological lesions in sheep and goats are similar to those induced in them by T. gondii, although there are subtle histopathological differences. These changes will aid possible diagnosis as will specific serological tests such as the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test and the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and the PCR. Sarcocystis, which exists as numerous species, undergoes a coccidian-like life cycle with each having a distinctive definitive (usually carnivore) host which excretes sporocysts into the environment. Clinical sarcocystiosis is much less commonly diagnosed than toxoplasmosis and neither is it normally associated with fetal infection or abortion in either sheep or goats. However, infection is extremely common throughout the world and follows ingestion of food or water contaminated with sporocysts. Clinical signs, when seen, include fever, anaemia, inappetance and weight loss or reduced weight gain. Central nervous signs (hind limb weakness, ataxia, paresis), acute myopathy and death may occur. Diagnosis is difficult as infection is so common and clinical signs absent, mild or non-specific. Serology may be useful in some situations and histopathology/immunohistochemistry is valuable for confirming the cause of death. Control relies on preventing contamination of pasture and water with faeces of dogs, foxes and cats or by controlling access of young susceptible stock to contaminated land. Relatively little is known of the immunity induced by infection with Sarcocystis spp. but research indicates that protective immunity does develop and that cell-mediated mechanisms are probably important. It is likely that sarcocystiosis is underdiagnosed as a problem and that better diagnostic methods are needed to show the true extent of the losses caused. Neosporosis on the other hand would appear not to be so common in sheep and goats. The value of experimental infections in these animals may be to provide a comparative model of the infection in cattle in the same way that our understanding of toxoplasmosis in sheep provides a superior model of human toxoplasmosis.",NA,"Animals; Coccidiosis; Goat Diseases; Goats; Neospora; Sarcocystosis; Sheep; Sheep Diseases; Toxoplasmosis, Animal","","Journal Article; Review"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specific characterization and quantification of hemodynamic abnormalities of the cavernous arterial inflow and corporeal veno-occlusive mechanism associated with failure to respond to intracavernous pharmacotherapy were performed retrospectively in 69 patients with nonendocrinological impotence. We investigated atherosclerotic vascular risk factors, duplex ultrasonography peak systolic and end diastolic velocities (10 micrograms. prostaglandin E1), and dynamic infusion cavernosometry and cavernosography parameters (60 mg. papaverine and 6 mg. phentolamine). RESULTS: The patients were stratified by severity of the various hemodynamic parameters encountered and mean dose required for response. Response subsequently was characterized as excellent (75% or greater rigid erections) in 36 patients, adequate (erections sufficient for intromission) in 17 and poor or absent in 16. Psychogenic, neurogenic and mild vasculogenic causes were noted in patients with an excellent response. The adequate responses included all 3 cases with mild to moderate vascular etiologies whereas patients with a poor or no response had only severe venogenic and combined arteriogenic and venogenic etiologies. Mean flow-to-maintain values plus or minus standard deviation of 9.7 +/- 3.7, 10.8 +/- 9.5 and 59.5 +/- 24.2 ml. per minute were demonstrated in the excellent, adequate and poor or no response groups, respectively. There was a good correlation between mean flow-to-maintain values and mean doses of our standard vasoactive solution (r2 = 0.88, p < 0.0001). Pharmaco-cavernosography demonstrated diffuse or pan-cavernous corporeal veno-occlusive dysfunction in the poor or no response group. CONCLUSIONS: Corporeal veno-occlusive dysfunction alone or combined with arterial disease is the specific hemodynamic abnormality causing nonresponse to intracavernous pharmacotherapy. Diffuse drainage, particularly involving the glans penis and corpus spongiosum, is greatly predictive of a poor or no response, reflecting the underlying cavernous smooth muscle myopathy and collagen degenerative alterations in these patients with end-organ failure.","10.1016/s0022-5347(01)65400-4","Adult; Aged; Alprostadil; Hemodynamics; Humans; Impotence, Vasculogenic; Male; Middle Aged; Penis; Phentolamine; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Failure; Vasodilator Agents; Veins","","Journal Article"

The response rate was 45%, with 475 cases and 425 comparisons eligible to participate. The most common disability type was spinal cord injury (24%), followed by polio (18%), muscular dystrophy (11%), cerebral palsy (11%), multiple sclerosis (10%), joint disorders (7%), and skeletal abnormalities (5%). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sexual-functioning, consisting of four factors: (1) sexual desire, (2) sexual activity, (3) sexual response, (4) sexual satisfaction. RESULTS: Highly significant differences were found in level of sexual activity (p = .000001), response (p = .000009), and satisfaction (p=.000001) between women with and without disabilities. No significant differences were found between groups on sexual desire. Severity of disability was not significantly related to level of sexual activity. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological and social factors exert a strong impact on the sexual functioning of women with physical disabilities. Further investigations is needed of the effect of social environment on development of self-esteem and sexual self-image, and how these influences affect levels of sexual functioning in women with physical disabilities.","10.1016/s0003-9993(96)90154-9","Adolescent; Adult; Body Image; Case-Control Studies; Persons with Disabilities; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Middle Aged; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Self Concept; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Social Environment; Surveys and Questionnaires","","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

In order to further restrict the region we screened for deletions in a set of 38 patients. We found two overlapping deletions in boys that in addition to MTM1 showed an unexpected abnormal genital development. As the latter phenotype is not found in the other non-deleted MTM1 patients, our observations are best explained by a contiguous gene syndrome.

RESULTS: One hundred thirteen subjects have been identified with HTLV-II infection in Spain with 4 being African immigrants residing in Madrid and the remaining being IDA from other European countries. Most were males (94/113; 83%). All were IDA except six (5 had acquired the infection by sexual contact and one by blood transfusion). Most of the IDA infected with HTLV-II were coinfected with HIV-1 (93/113; 83%). No patient showed clinical manifestations attributable to HTLV-II infection although one drug addict male coinfected with HIV-1 and HTLV-II developed a non-inflammatory proximal myopathy.

Serious morbidity from this disorder of iron absorption can occur in early as well as in middle and advanced age, iron overload having been reported in children with hereditary hemochromatosis as early as 2 years of age. Younger persons differ from older persons in that the risk for iron loading in females appears to be equal to the risk for males, in contrast to a preponderance of males among older patients. Also, younger patients frequently demonstrate cardiac and gonadal involvement, with cardiac failure commonly leading to death, whereas older patients are more likely to have liver involvement and diabetes mellitus, with liver failure and hepatoma commonly leading to death. Because early diagnosis and treatment can prevent the toxicities of iron overload, appropriate screening can be lifesaving. Transferrin saturation is the most reliable screening test. Liver biopsy with objective measurement of hepatic iron stores is the most important diagnostic criterion at present, although reliable noninvasive methods for quantitating body iron are being developed. Young individuals who should be screened for iron overload include patients with cardiac myopathies, hypogonadism, amenorrhea, loss of libido, diabetes mellitus, other endocrine disorders, cirrhosis of the liver, and arthritis, as well as the siblings, parents, and children of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or iron loading of unknown cause.","10.1097/00043426-198821000-00006","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Gene Frequency; Hemochromatosis; Humans; Iron; Neoplasms","","Journal Article; Review"

While many studies have investigated fertility problems in females, data on males-related fertility are scarce, which explains the lack of guidance. The main objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the reproductive health in males with ARRDs. This systematic review followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews guidelines. Original articles from Pubmed and Scopus, published until September 16, 2021, and tackling the effects of ARRDs and/or ARRDs treatments on male fertility and/or pregnancy outcomes, were included. A total of twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. They were published between 1981 and 2018. The studied ARRDs were spondyloarthritis (n = 9), systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 6), Behcet disease (BD, n = 5), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 5), antiphospholipid syndrome (n = 1), and dermatomyositis (n = 1). The most reported effects of ARRDs on fertility are i) high levels of reproductive hormones, mainly in RA and SLE; ii) impaired semen quality in SLE, spondyloarthritis, and BD; and iii) higher rate of varicocele in BD and spondyloarthritis. Regarding the treatments effects, i) conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (e.g.; methotrexate and salazopyrine) increase testosterone level, ii) cyclophosphamide impairs fertility, iii) anti-tumor necrosis factor agents are associated with improvement in semen quality, and iv) no increased number of miscarriages or congenital abnormalities in children fathered by BD was reported. To conclude, both ARRDs and their treatments alter fertility in males with ARRDs. In practice, in addition to the conventional semen analysis, screening for infertility seems legitimate in males with ARRDs.","10.1016/j.jri.2021.103472","Autoimmune Diseases; Child; Female; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Pregnancy; Reproductive Health; Rheumatic Diseases; Semen Analysis; Spondylarthritis","Antiphospholipid syndrome; Behcet syndrome; Dermatomyositis; Fertility; Rheumatic diseases; Sexual health; Spondylarthropathies rheumatoid arthritis; Systemic lupus erythematosus","Journal Article; Systematic Review"

Methods. Twenty-eight patients with PM/DM performed recommended outcomes as well as the MACTAR, which was performed twice with one week apart. Results. Sexual activity, walking, biking, social activities, and sleep constituted the predominating disabilities. Seventy-two and 33% of the identified disabilities were not covered by items of the Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Myositis Activities Profile.

Auto-immune diseases develop in individuals with a genetic pre-disposition. Among the endogenous factors, also sexual hormones play a role, especially prolactin. The objective of the study was to use basal exam and TRH test to determine stimulated prolactin values in patients with a systemic connective tissue disease: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome, dermatomyositis. PATIENT GROUP AND METHODS: The authors examined 43 patients with systemic connective tissue diseases: 20 patients with SLE, 7 patients with Sjögren's syndrome, 7 patients with systemic sclerosis and 9 patients with dermatomyositis. The mean age of the patients was 39.87 years. The control group consisted of 30 volunteers with a mean age of 35.17 years. OUTCOME: Prolactin level in the patients with systemic connective tissue diseases was 14.629 ng/ml, which is more than in the control group. A statistically significant increase in prolactin level was recorded 20 minutes after i.v. stimulation as compared with the control group (30.982 ng/ml). This statistically significant difference was still present 60 minutes after the TRH administration, with 16.43 ng/ml in the control group, and 36.890 ng/ml in the systemic connective tissue disorder patient group. The differences between prolactin levels for the different systemic connective tissue diseases were not statistically significant. A positive correlation in the patient group was found between the stimulated prolactin values and the FW value. On the whole, however, there was no clear correlation found between laboratory activity and prolactin levels. CONCLUSION: The authors found out that post-stimulation prolactin levels were statistically significantly higher in patients with systemic connective tissue disease as compared with the control group. Correlation analyses did not show a clear link between inflammatory activity and prolactin levels, and therefore the authors assume that medium increased values of prolactin are rather a risk factor for the disease than an inflammation marker in patients with a systemic connective tissue disease.",NA,"Adult; Autoimmune Diseases; Connective Tissue Diseases; Female; Humans; Male; Prolactin; Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone","","English Abstract; Journal Article"

When the risk of developing autoimmune diseases such as uveitis, polymyositis, and arthritis is included, one can estimate the life-long risk of infected individuals to develop an HTLV associated pathology as approximately 10%. The populations at risk are, in a large majority, from developing countries but the epidemic of HTLV-II infection in intravenous drug users (IVDU) represents a possible reservoir for dissemination in the general population. The number of HTLV-I-infected individuals (15 to 25 million), together with the severity of associated disease, justifies the development of a vaccine. Different vaccine preparations have been developed, using mostly recombinant pox and adenoviruses, but DNA plasmid technology will soon become a feasible approach. Various animal models exist for experimental viral infections, involving rats, rabbits, or monkeys, but up to now, neither hematological nor neurological disorders have been induced by HTLV infection in such animal models. For long-term protection from HTLV-I-associated diseases, vaccination should induce both neutralizing antibodies and specific cell-mediated immunity. This will require the incorporation of both env and gag coding sequences in the vaccine preparations. Preventive clinical trials may involve different cohorts of seronegative young girls from endemic areas prior to sexual activity and IVDU in the industrialized world. In parallel, one should consider therapeutic vaccine trials in HTLV-I-positive mothers and IVDU to protect them against disease development. The observed rate of seroconversion in these different cohorts makes such trials feasible.","10.1097/00042560-199600001-00029","Animals; Antibody Formation; Cancer Vaccines; Clinical Trials as Topic; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Products, gag; Haplorhini; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; Human T-lymphotropic virus 2; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Leukemia, T-Cell; Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic; Rabbits; Rats; Recombination, Genetic; Vaccination; Viral Envelope Proteins","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

Neuroinflammation can affect cells and processes in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as immune cells, and might precede protein aggregation, which is a hallmark of the neurodegenerative process. Standard treatment methods are far from being able to counteract inflammation and delay neurodegeneration. Remarkably, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5is), which represent potent vasoactive drugs used as a first-line treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED), display important anti-inflammatory effects through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level stabilization. Since PDE5 hydrolyzes cGMP, several studies positioned PDE5 as a therapeutic target, and more specifically, PDE5is as potential alternative strategies for the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders. Indeed, PDE5is can limit neuroinflammation and enhance synaptic plasticity, with beneficial effects on cognitive function and memory. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of some of the main processes underlying neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration which may be potential targets for PDE5is, focusing on sildenafil, the most extensively studied.

In order to address this unmet need, we sought to develop a reproducible model of BDNF reduction by inducing traumatic brain injury (TBI) using a closed head momentum exchange injury model in mature 9-month-old male and female rats. Head impacts were repetitive and varied in intensity from mild to severe. BDNF levels, as assessed by ELISA, were significantly reduced in the hippocampus of both males and females as well as in the substantia nigra of males 12 days after mild TBI.

Cordyceps has been used in traditional medicine due to its immense health benefits, as it boosts stamina, appetite, immunity, longevity, libido, memory, and sleep. Neuronal loss is the typical feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) and neurotrauma.

The preferred method of assessment was completing questionnaires, at home. The overwhelming majority of people with motor neuron disease report non-motor symptoms and these frequently co-occur. Pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal issues, sleep, mood, anxiety, problematic saliva, apathy, emotional lability, cognitive complaints and sexual dysfunction are prevalent. People with motor neuron disease who had worse physical function and those who were long survivors were more likely to report more symptoms. Where reported, these symptoms are frequent, impactful and a priority for people with motor neuron disease in clinical care and trial design.","10.1093/braincomms/fcad336","","impact; motor neuron disease; non-motor symptoms; prevalence; survey","Journal Article"

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of multiple traumas, including sexual assault and life-threatening physical injuries, as well as a recent diagnosis of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). For most of her life, she relied on extreme idealization of important people in her life as her primary defense mechanism, helping her to maintain physical and psychological survival. However, after a KAP session in January 2023 she discovered the consequences of her extreme idealizing tendencies. Among these was the creation of troubling double binds for the people she idealized, as well as the fomentation of conflict between these individuals with each other. Also unconscious was the secondary gain offered by her escalating physical symptoms and pain-that is, the ability to resolve conflicts between those she idealized-and how this secondary gain increased the likelihood of symptom exacerbations during periods of conflict. After the discovery of these unconscious tendencies during her KAP session, the patient has since been able to avoid extreme idealization of important people in her life and has subsequently experienced fewer episodes of exacerbation of her physical symptoms. Consistent with the opinions of clinicians and researchers published in the literature, the achievement of a psychedelic trance state appeared necessary for the success of the patient's KAP treatment.","10.1521/pdps.2023.51.4.467","Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Ketamine; Psychotherapy, Psychodynamic; Psychotherapy; Mental Disorders","ketamine-assisted psychotherapy; psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy; psychiatry; psychodynamic psychotherapy","Case Reports; Journal Article"

METHODS: We selected 11 patients with sALS (7 men), 14 with fALS8 (8 men) and 26 controls (15 men). All groups were gender and age-matched. For each subject, Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease for Autonomic Symptoms (SCOPA-AUT) was applied and data from heart rate variability, Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART) and skin sympathetic response (SSR) were collected. These data were compared across groups using nonparametric tests. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: SCOPA-AUT revealed predominant clinical complaints in thermoregulatory, pupillomotor and sexual domains in fALS8 relative to sALS as well as controls. Neurophysiological tests demonstrated significant differences in Valsalva ratio, Expiratory:Inspiratory index and RR minimum values in both ALS groups relative to controls. Sudomotor dysfunction was also observed in sALS and fALS8 groups, as shown by reduced medial forearm and foot QSART volumes and absence of SSR in lower limbs. CONCLUSIONS: Dysautonomia - cardiac and sudomotor - is part of the phenotype in sALS and fALS8. The profile of autonomic symptoms, however, is different in each group.

Recent findings indicate that the pathological acetylation state of NF-κB/RelA and histone 3 (H3) occurring in the SOD1(G93A) murine model of ALS can be corrected by the synergistic combination of low doses of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-sirtuin 1 pathway activator resveratrol and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors MS-275 (entinostat) or valproate. The combination of the epigenetic drugs, by rescuing RelA and the H3 acetylation state, promotes a beneficial and sexually dimorphic effect on disease onset, survival and motor neurons degeneration.

RECENT FINDINGS: Sex is a crucial factor in the response to toxicants, yet the sex-specific effects of OP exposure, particularly in juveniles and adults, remain unresolved. This is largely due to study design and inconsistencies in exposure and outcome assessments. Exposure to OPs results in multiple adverse outcomes influenced by many factors including sex. Reported sex-specific effects suggest that males are more susceptible to OPs, which reflects the sex-dependent prevalence of various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in which males are at greater risk. Thus, this review proposes that the biological sex-specific effects elicited by OP exposure may in part underlie the dimorphic susceptibilities observed in neurological disorders. Understanding the immediate and long-term effects of OP exposure across sexes will be critical in advancing our understanding of OP-induced neurotoxicity and disease.","10.1007/s40572-017-0171-y","Environmental Exposure; Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Occupational Exposure; Organophosphates; Pesticides; Sex Characteristics","Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurodevelopment; Organophosphate; Pesticides; Sex; Sexual dimorphism","Journal Article; Review; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Alterations in AR function are central to reproductive disorders, prostate cancer, and Kennedy disease. AR activity is influenced by post-translational modifications, but their role in AR-based diseases is poorly understood. Conjugation by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins at two synergy control (SC) motifs in AR exerts a promoter context-dependent inhibitory role. SC motifs are composed of a four-amino acid core that is often preceded and/or followed by nearby proline or glycine residues. The function of these flanking residues, however, has not been examined directly. Remarkably, several AR mutations associated with oligospermia and androgen insensitivity syndrome map to Pro-390, the conserved proline downstream of the first SC motif in AR. Similarly, mutations at Gly-524, downstream of the second SC motif, were recovered in recurrent prostate cancer samples. We now provide evidence that these clinically isolated substitutions lead to a partial loss of SC motif function and AR SUMOylation that affects multiple endogenous genes. Consistent with a structural role as terminators of secondary structure elements, substitution of Pro-390 by Gly fully supports both SC motif function and SUMOylation. As predicted from the functional properties of SC motifs, the clinically isolated mutations preferentially enhance transcription driven by genomic regions harboring multiple AR binding sites. The data support the view that alterations in AR SUMOylation play significant roles in AR-based diseases and offer novel SUMO-based therapeutic opportunities.","10.1074/jbc.M112.395210","Amino Acid Motifs; Androgen-Insensitivity Syndrome; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Prostatic Neoplasms; Receptors, Androgen; Sumoylation","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

Improvement of quality of life at old age and prevention of age-associated diseases have become the main focus of the aging research. The process of aging in humans is complex and underlies multiple influences, with the probable involvement of heritable and various environmental factors. In particular, hormones are decisively involved in the generation of aging. Over time, important circulating hormones decline due to a reduced secretion of the pituitary, the adrenal glands and the gonads or due to an intercurrent disease. Among them, serum levels of growth factors and sexual steroids show significant aging-associated changes. Within the scope of the Explorative Project 'Genetic aetiology of human longevity' supported by the German National Genome Research Network 2 (NGFN-2) an in vitro model of human hormonal aging has been developed. Human SZ95 sebocytes were maintained under a hormone-substituted environment consisting of growth factors and sexual steroids in concentrations corresponding to those circulating in 20- and in 60-year-old women. Eight hundred and ninety-nine genes showed a differential expression in SZ95 sebocytes maintained under the 20- and 60-year-old hormone mixture, respectively. Among them genes were regulated which are involved in biological processes which are all hallmarks of aging. The most significantly altered signaling pathway identified was that of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). A disturbed function of this cascade has been associated with tumorigenesis, i.e. in pancreatic, prostate, intestine, breast, and uterine cancer. Interestingly, genes expressed in signaling pathways operative in age-associated diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were also identified. These data demonstrate that skin and its appendages may represent an adequate model for aging research. Hormones interact in a complex fashion, and aging may be partly attributed to the changes in their circulating blood levels. Furthermore, a disturbed hormone status may partially act towards the manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, these results could be a basis for an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of the aging process.","10.1016/j.exger.2007.07.002","Aging; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome, Human; Hormones; Humans; Models, Biological; Sebaceous Glands; Skin Aging","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

This hypothesis is strongly supported by experimental and clinical observations indicating that inhibition of the inflammatory reaction correlates with less neuronal damage. Estrogens are thought to play a role in the sex difference observed in many neurological diseases with inflammatory components including stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Clinical and experimental studies have established estrogen as a neuroprotective hormone in these diseases. However, the exact mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of estrogens are still unclear. It is possible that the beneficial effects of these hormones may be dependent on their inhibitory activity on the inflammatory reaction associated with the above-mentioned brain pathologies.

In this regard, an important role has been suggested for pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by activated glial cells, neurons and immune cells that invade brain tissue. Within the CNS, cytokines stimulate inflammatory processes that may impair blood-brain barrier permeability as well as promote apoptosis of neurons, oligodendrocytes and induce myelin damage. Given that estrogen may modulate cytokine expression, coupled with the fact that gender differences of cytokine production are apparent in animal models of PD and MS, suggests an important connection between hormonal-cytokine link in neurodegeneration. Indeed, while MS patients and mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) display gender specific alterations of IFN-gamma and IL-12, variations of TNF and IL-6 were associated with PD. Also in case of more acute neurodegenerative conditions, such as stroke, the effect of IL-6 gene G-174C polymorphism was different in males and females. Given that our understanding of the role of estrogen on cytokine production and accompanying CNS pathological conditions is limited, the present reviews aims to present some of our recent findings in this area and further evaluate the evidence that may be relevant to the design of new hormonal anti-inflammatory treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.","10.2174/1381612053381693","Animals; Cytokines; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Male; Nervous System Diseases; Sex Characteristics","","Journal Article; Review"

Mutations in the AR cause various degrees of androgen resistance resulting in a range of androgen insensitivity syndromes. A single copy gene in the X chromosome encodes the AR. The gene contains a polymorphic triple repeat sequence [(CAG)n] with 9-36 repeats in the normal population, and displays ethnic dependence. In vitro, there is an inverse correlation between CAG repeat length and AR function. Associations exist between short alleles and prostate cancer in men or clinical hyperandrogenism in women. Expansion of the CAG tract > 40 repeats leads to spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy disease), an adult onset neurodegenerative disease that also presents with low virilization and spermatogenetic defects. The disease may show evidence of anticipation (increasing severity with succeeding generations accompanying further expansion of repeat length). Twelve studies involving Singaporean, Australian, North American and Japanese men reported a relationship between AR CAG repeat length and male infertility, whereas 10 studies, most of them European, found no association. Differences in hereditary or acquired factors in these populations may explain the equivocality. However, statistical methods, sample sizes, study definition and control populations, in addition to laboratory methods vary widely within the published papers, and could affect the results and conclusions. Current data is insufficient to conclude whether IVF patients who display AR CAG expansion may transfer infertility or premutation of neurodegenerative disease to their descendants. We recommend screening of AR CAG repeat length, at least in those populations where an association between repeat length and infertility could be found.",NA,"Humans; Infertility, Male; Male; Mutation; Receptors, Androgen; Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion; Trinucleotide Repeats","","English Abstract; Journal Article; Review"

The use of optimal control strategies involving information campaigns about insect repellents and condoms alongside an available safe and effective vaccine can prevent the number of infected humans with ZIKV. A system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is formulated for the transmission dynamics of ZIKV in the presence of three control strategies to evaluate the impact of various scenarios during a ZIKV epidemic. In addition, we estimate parameters using weekly incidence data from previous ZIKV outbreaks in Colombia and Puerto Rico to capture the dynamics of an epidemic in each country when control measures are available. The basic reproduction number, R0, of each country is calculated using estimated parameters (without the controls). The vector-borne transmission threshold (Rv) is dominant in both countries , but the sexual transmission threshold (Rd) in Colombia is considerably higher than in Puerto Rico. Numerical simulations for Colombia show that the most effective strategies are to use three controls since the start of the outbreak. However, for Puerto Rico only information campaigns about mosquito repellents and vaccination are the most effective ways to mitigate the epidemic.","10.1016/j.jtbi.2023.111647","","Basic reproduction number; Dynamical systems; Epidemiology; Infectious disease modeling; Optimal control theory","Journal Article"

The virus was initially identified in a rhesus monkey in Uganda in 1947 and later in a human in Nigeria in 1952. Since 2007, the prevalence of the virus has been on the rise, culminating in a major outbreak in the United States (US) in 2015. During this outbreak, the adult population was severely impacted, experiencing a range of symptoms, including organ failure, microcephaly, fetal death, and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Additionally, skin rash, limb swelling, fever, headache, and heightened sensitivity are found in most adults with Zika syndrome. Although the virus can be transmitted through blood, vertical transmission from mother to child, and sexual contact, the primary way of transmission of the virus is through the Aedes mosquito. Cells such as neurons, macrophages, peripheral dendritic cells, and placental cells are among the target cells that the virus can infect. The TAM AXL receptor plays a crucial role in infection. After the virus enters the body through the bloodstream, it spreads in the body with a latent period of 3 to 12 days. Currently, there is no specific treatment or publicly available vaccine for the ZIKV. Limited laboratory testing has been conducted, and existing drugs originally designed for other pathogens have been repurposed for treatment. Given the Aedes mosquito's role as a vector and the wide geographical impact of the virus, this study aims to comprehensively investigate Zika's pathogenesis and clinical symptoms based on existing knowledge and research. By doing so, we seek to enhance our understanding of the virus and inform future prevention and treatment strategies.","10.1186/s12985-024-02547-z","Zika Virus Infection; Zika Virus; Humans; Viral Tropism; Animals; Aedes; Mosquito Vectors; Disease Outbreaks; Female","Clinical manifestations; Congenital Zika syndrome; Neurological complications; Pathogenesis; Zika virus (ZIKV)","Journal Article; Review"

We aimed to determine the dietary intake of vitamin B6, folate, and vitamin B12 and ED in the United States population. METHODS: We extracted data from the 2001-2004 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Dietary intakes of B vitamins were collected based on one 24-hour dietary recall. The association between dietary intake of vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12 and ED was examined using multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 3,875 participants were included for analysis, with 1,201 reporting ED and 2,894 not experiencing ED.

The absence of FDA-approved drugs or vaccines presents a substantial obstacle in combatting the virus. Furthermore, the inclusion of pregnancy in the pharmacological screening process complicates and extends the endeavor to ensure molecular safety and minimal toxicity. Given its pivotal role in viral assembly and maturation, the NS2B-NS3 viral protease emerges as a promising therapeutic target against ZIKV. In this context, a dipeptide inhibitor was specifically chosen as a control against 200 compounds for docking analysis. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations extending over 200 ns were conducted to ascertain the stability of the docked complex and confirm the binding of the inhibitor at the protein's active site. The simulation outcomes exhibited conformity to acceptable thresholds, encompassing parameters such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), ligand-protein interaction analysis, ligand characterization, and surface area analysis. Notably, analysis of ligand angles bolstered the identification of prospective ligands capable of inhibiting viral protein activity and impeding virus dissemination. In this study, the integration of molecular docking and dynamics simulations has pinpointed the dipeptide inhibitor as a potential candidate ligand against ZIKV protease, thereby offering promise for therapeutic intervention against the virus.","10.1371/journal.pone.0307902","Zika Virus; Molecular Docking Simulation; Dipeptides; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Protease Inhibitors; Antiviral Agents; Serine Endopeptidases; Humans; Protein Binding; Viral Proteases; Nucleoside-Triphosphatase; DEAD-box RNA Helicases","","Journal Article"

Transmission is predominantly vector-borne, but sexual transmission has been described, mainly among travelers, although it undoubtedly accounts for a significant proportion of transmission in epidemic areas. The aim of this review is to describe this sexual transmission, mainly through examples linked to this large-scale epidemic in Latin America, to describe the link with prolonged excretion of infectious viral particles in genital secretions, especially semen but also vaginal secretions, and to highlight possible preventive measures apart from vector transmission, in particular the need for pregnant women or women wishing to become pregnant to avoid visiting countries where circulation of Zika virus is described.

For this study, 2-month-old male BALB/c mice were infected with 1.26 x 106 PFU/mL of ZIKV in solution via the intravenous route. After three, seven, and fourteen days post-infection (DPI), blood and testicle samples were obtained to detect ZIKV RNA. The authors observed that the infected animals had slower weight gain than the control group. Viremia occurred only at 3DPI, and the ZIKV RNA was detected in one testis sample at 7DPI. The histopathological analysis of this organ revealed intense disorganization of the seminiferous tubules' structure, inflammatory infiltrate, necrosis, hemorrhage, fluid accumulation, congestion of blood vessels, and reduced sperm count. Ultrastructural analysis showed nuclear changes in tubule cells, activation of interstitial cells, and morphological changes in spermatozoa, in addition to fragmentation and decreased electron density of the genetic material of these cells. Thus, despite causing predominantly asymptomatic infections, ZIKV can cause significant subclinical and transient damage, including to male reproductive organs.","10.1590/1984-3143-AR2023-0124","","Inbred BALB/c mice; Zika virus; testis","Journal Article"

These viruses can also be transmitted through sexual contact, vertical transmission, and possibly transfusion. Most cases are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include rash, conjunctivitis, fever, and arthralgia, which are characteristic of other arboviruses. Zika infection can lead to complications such as microcephaly, miscarriage, brain abnormalities, and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). OBJECTIVE: The aim is to determine the inhibitory potential of the algae Kappaphycus alvarezii (K. alvarezii) on ZIKV replication. METHODOLOGY: Cytotoxicity experiments were performed using Vero cells to determine the CC50, and ZIKV replication inhibition assays (ATCC® VR-1839™) were conducted to determine the EC50. The mechanism of action was also studied to assess any synergistic effect with Ribavirin. RESULTS: K. alvarezii demonstrated low toxicity with a CC50 of 423 μg/mL and a potent effect on ZIKV replication with an EC50 of 0.65 μg/mL and a Selectivity Index (SI) of 651, indicating the extract's safety. Virucidal effect assays were carried out to evaluate the possible mechanism of action, and the compound addition time was studied, showing the potential to delay the treatment of infected cells by up to 6 hours. A potential synergistic effect was observed when K. alvarezii extract was combined with suboptimal concentrations of Ribavirin, resulting in 99% inhibition of viral replication. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the significant potential of K. alvarezii extract and highlight the need for further studies to investigate its mechanism of action. We propose this extract as a potential anti-Zika compound.","10.2174/0115680266294503240513044930","Antiviral Agents; Zika Virus; Animals; Chlorocebus aethiops; Vero Cells; Seaweed; Virus Replication; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Structure-Activity Relationship; Ribavirin; Plant Extracts; Edible Seaweeds; Rhodophyta","Antiviral; Arbovirus; Rhodophyta; Seaweed; Vero cells.; Zika","Journal Article"

Exercise therapy is often used to mitigate the adverse effects of treatment. But how good is the evidence base, and what has changed in recent years? In this narrative review, we present the current data and what it implies for the care of adults with cancer. METHODS: This review is based on data from meta-analyses and systematic reviews concerning 16 relevant clinical endpoints (outcomes) of exercise therapy for cancer patients. RESULTS: The literature evaluated for this paper reveals that targeted exercise therapy is feasible and safe under appropriate supervision. It is highly effective for improving eight endpoints (anxiety, depression, fatigue, quality of life, physical function, secondary lymphedema after breast cancer, urinary incontinence, post-mastectomy pain syndrome in breast cancer) and may also have a beneficial effect on sleep quality, cardiotoxicity, and cognitive function. Less conclusive studies are currently available with respect to chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy, nausea/vomiting, and bone health. There is currently insufficient data to suggest any benefit with respect to sexual function and risk factors for falling. CONCLUSION: The data shows that exercise therapy for cancer patients is safe and has manifold effects on selected clinically relevant parameters. Further studies should be performed regarding the possible utility of exercise therapy against treatment-related side effects for which the evidence is currently insufficient.

A total of 162 patients had an interest in sex and were sexually active (Group A). A total of 45 patients had an interest in sex and were sexually not active (Group I) and 437 patients had no interest in sex and were not sexually active (Group N). Group A was younger in median age (age at randomization), at 57 years, than Group I, at 60 years, and Group N, at 65 years (p < 0.001). Group A had a better ECOG performance status and fewer recurrences (all p < 0.001). FIGO stage, grading, and BMI were not associated with interest in sex and sexual activity. Group A showed higher scores in role, body, and social function (all p < 0.001), emotional functionality (p < 0.002), and body image (p = 0.012). In addition, Group A reported less pain, less peripheral neuropathy, and less fatigue (all p < 0.001). There was no association with the premature discontinuation of chemotherapy. Group A showed better survival rates compared to group N (22.3 months vs. 17.4 months, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should routinely address the topic of sexuality with ovarian cancer patients. Sexuality appears to be a marker for quality of life as well as overall survival.","10.3390/cancers16040811","","discontinuation of chemotherapy; interest in sex; ovarian cancer; quality of life; sexual activity; survival","Journal Article"

[et al]","2024","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical results and long-term patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) on quality of life in cervical cancer patients following radiochemotherapy (RCT) and brachytherapy (BT) as definitive treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2003 and 2023, a total of 132 patients with advanced cervical cancer were evaluated for possible treatment. Patients treated by postoperative RCT, palliative radiotherapy, and those treated for recurrent disease were excluded. Thus, 46 patients receiving standard RCT and BT as their curative treatment were included in this study. PROMs were assessed prospectively by patients' self-completion of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-CX24 questionnaires. RESULTS: Five-year overall survival (OS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), and pelvic tumor-free survival rates (PTFS) were 53%, 54%, and 83%, respectively. A significant impact on OS was seen for FIGO (International Federation of Gynecologic Oncology) stage (IIB-IIIA: 79% vs. IIIB-IVA: 33%, p = 0.015), for overall treatment time (OTT; 50-65 d: 64% vs. > 65 d: 38%, p = 0.004), and for rectal D2cc (≤ 73 Gy: 50% vs. > 73 Gy: 38%, p = 0.046). The identical parameters were significantly associated with DMFS (FIGO stage: p = 0.012, OTT: p = 0.008, D2cc: p = 0.024). No parameters with a significant influence on PTFS were seen. In multivariate analysis, an impact of FIGO stage on OS (p = 0.05) and DMFS (p = 0.014) was detected, and of rectal D2cc on DMFS (p = 0.031). The overall QoL score was 63/100. Cognitive function was the least impaired (84/100), while role functioning was the worst (67/100). On the symptom scale, insomnia (46/100), fatigue (41/100), dyspnea (32/100), pain (26/100), and financial difficulties (25/100) were scored the worst. According to EORTC-QLQ-CX24, peripheral neuropathy (36/100) and lymphedema (32/100) occurred most frequently. Impaired sexual/vaginal functioning (32/100) and body image (22/100) were also frequently recorded. CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced cervical cancer, a combination of RCT and BT remains an excellent treatment option. In terms of patient-reported long-term quality of life, specific support is needed to alleviate symptoms including lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, and impaired sexual activity.","10.1007/s00066-023-02196-1","Humans; Female; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Brachytherapy; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Chemoradiotherapy; Aged; Adult; Quality of Life; Neoplasm Staging; Treatment Outcome; Aged, 80 and over; Prospective Studies","External radiation and interstitial brachytherapy; Locally advanced cervical cancer; Quality of life; Questionnaires; Radiochemotherapy","Journal Article"

However, there was insufficient evidence to generate exercise prescriptions for 10 health outcomes of cancer treatment. We sought to update the state of evidence. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of these 10 understudied health outcomes (bone health, sleep, cardiovascular function, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), cognitive function, falls and balance, nausea, pain, sexual function, and treatment tolerance) and provided an update of evidence. RESULTS: While the evidence base for each outcome has increased, there remains insufficient evidence to generate exercise prescriptions. Common limitations observed across outcomes included: variability in type and quality of outcome measurement tools, variability in definitions of the health outcomes, a lack of phase III trials, and a majority of trials investigating breast or prostate cancer survivors only. CONCLUSION: We identified progress in the field of exercise oncology for several understudied cancer- and treatment-related health outcomes. However, we were not able to generate exercise prescriptions due to continued insufficient evidence base.

The aim of this study was to identify existing PA guidelines for cancer survivors, describe the recommendations, and assess their methodology quality. METHODS: A rapid review of the literature was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE, supplemented by a search of the grey literature. The methodological quality of the guidelines was assessed using the AGREE II checklist. A descriptive synthesis of the recommendations from guidelines judged to be of good quality has been performed. RESULTS: A total of nine guidelines published between 2006 and 2019 were included. Of nine guidelines, five achieved a high enough AGREE II score and were judged to be of good quality for use in clinical practice. We found that the recommendations from the five guidelines converged on the prescription of supervised PA (aerobic and resistance exercise) of at least 75 min per week of high intensity or 150 min per week of moderate intensity, spread over two to five sessions per week, equating to a PA dose between 8.70 and 17.5 MET.h/week. The recommendations were applicable to address the most common side effects of cancer and its treatment, namely fatigue, lymphedema, anxiety, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life (QoL), survival, and physical function. However, no guideline recommends PA to improve other cancer-related outcomes, such as cognitive impairment, falls, sexual function, and peripheral neuropathy frequently experienced by cancer survivors. No guideline also referred to work outcomes (i.e., work ability, return to work, etc.). CONCLUSION: Most PA guidelines for cancer survivors are of good quality. However, specific PA guidelines are needed for a given cancer site (e.g., location, stage), at a particular phase of the cancer trajectory, and for specific outcomes including return to work (RTW) in order to tailor PA to each cancer survivor.","10.1007/s00520-023-08123-5","Humans; Quality of Life; Neoplasms; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Exercise","Cancer; Guidelines; Physical activity; Recommendations","Journal Article; Review"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 180 participants (120 T2DM and 60 controls) in the cross-sectional study. First, we compared the serum ISM1 concentration in diabetic patients and non-diabetic controls. Secondly, according to DSPN, patients were divided into DSPN and non-DSPN groups. Last, patients were categorized as lean T2DM (15 males, 15 females), overweight T2DM (35 males, 19 females), and obese T2DM groups (23 males, 13 females) according to gender and body mass index (BMI). All participants were collected with clinical characteristics and biochemical profiles. Serum ISM1 was detected in all subjects by ELISA. RESULTS: Higher serum ISM1 [7.78 ng/mL (IQR: 6.33-9.06) vs 5.22 (3.86-6.04), P <0.001] was observed in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic controls. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that serum ISM1 was a risk factor for type 2 diabetes after adjustment (OR=4.218, 95% CI: 1.843-9.653, P=0.001). Compared to the non-DSPN group, serum ISM1 level was not changed significantly in patients who suffered from DSPN. Diabetic females with obesity had lower level of serum ISM1 (7.10±1.29 ng/mL) when compared to the lean T2DM (8.42±1.36 ng/mL, P <0.05) and the overweight T2DM (8.33±1.27 ng/mL, P <0.05). However, serum ISM1 was not changed significantly in male groups or all patients together. CONCLUSION: Serum ISM1 was a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and it was associated with diabetic adults with obesity while there was sexual dimorphism. However, serum ISM1 levels were not correlated with DSPN.","10.2147/DMSO.S411127","","diabetic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy; inflammation; isthmin-1; obesity; type 2 diabetes","Journal Article"

ZIKV can be transmitted between sexual partners and from mother to fetus. Infection is strongly associated with neurologic complications in adults, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and myelitis, and congenital ZIKV infection can result in fetal injury and congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Development of an effective vaccine is imperative to protect against ZIKV vertical transmission and CZS. Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis virus (rVSV) is a highly effective and safe vector for the delivery of foreign immunogens for vaccine purposes. Here, we evaluate an rVSV vaccine expressing the full length pre-membrane (prM) and ZIKV envelope (E) proteins (VSV-ZprME), shown to be immunogenic in murine models of ZIKV infection, for its capacity to induce immune responses in nonhuman primates. Moreover, we assess the efficacy of the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine in the protection of pigtail macaques against ZIKV infection. Administration of the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine was safe, but it did not induce robust anti-ZIKV T-cell responses, IgM or IgG antibodies, or neutralizing antibodies in most animals. Post ZIKV challenge, animals that received the rVSVΔM control vaccine lacking ZIKV antigen had higher levels of plasma viremia compared to animals that received the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine. Anti-ZIKV neutralizing Ab titers were detected in a single animal that received the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine that was associated with reduced plasma viremia. The overall suboptimal ZIKV-specific cellular and humoral responses post-immunization indicates the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine did not elicit an immune response in this pilot study. However, recall antibody response to the rVSVΔM-ZprME vaccine indicates it may be immunogenic and further developments to the vaccine construct could enhance its potential as a vaccine candidate in a nonhuman primate pre-clinical model.","10.3389/fviro.2023.1108420","","","Journal Article"

However, this has not stopped the virus from infecting the human population globally. In particular, the global spread of ZIKV has led to a surge in observational studies. METHODS: Regarding recently published ZIKV-related literature, we are not aware of any reviews strictly focusing on ZIKV from the perspective of observational studies. Therefore, we reviewed recently published observational studies exploring the global spread of ZIKV and its association with Congenital ZIKV Infection (CZI) and clinical manifestations in adults. Online databases including google scholar, PubMed and Elsevier were used for retrieving relevant studies. RESULTS: ZIKV cases have been reported in different parts of the world, with certain regions reporting more cases than the rest, like Brazil. ZIKV causes a wide spectrum of diseases and disorders including microcephaly, developmental disorders, and Guillain-Barre syndrome to name a few. Furthermore, CZI in neonates mainly manifests into neurological disorders and diseases, whereas ZIKV in adults' targets various organs. CONCLUSION: ZIKV poses a serious threat to human population and observational studies provide a different perspective on the damaging capabilities of ZIKV in real-life settings. Moreover, there are gaps in the literature regarding ZIKV-related-complications that future experimental studies need to address. These complications include in-utero transmission, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cross-reactivity, sexual transmission, along with its persistence in the male reproductive tract.","10.18502/jad.v16i4.12188","","Arbovirus; Congenital zika infection; Flavivirus; Zika virus","Journal Article; Review"
"36584063","Modeling the spread of the Zika virus by sexual and mosquito transmission.","Agudelo S; Ventresca M","PloS one","2022","Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that is transmitted predominantly by the Aedes species of mosquito, but also through sexual contact, blood transfusions, and congenitally from mother to child. Although approximately 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic and typical symptoms are mild, multiple studies have demonstrated a causal link between ZIKV and severe diseases such as Microcephaly and Guillain Barré Syndrome. Two goals of this study are to improve ZIKV models by considering the spread dynamics of ZIKV as both a vector-borne and sexually transmitted disease, and also to approximate the degree of under-reporting. In order to accomplish these objectives, we propose a compartmental model that allows for the analysis of spread dynamics as both a vector-borne and sexually transmitted disease, and fit it to the ZIKV incidence reported to the National System of Public Health Surveillance in 27 municipalities of Colombia between January 1 2015 and December 31 2017. We demonstrate that our model can represent the infection patterns over this time period with high confidence. In addition, we argue that the degree of under-reporting is also well estimated. Using the model we assess potential viability of public health scenarios for mitigating disease spread and find that targeting the sexual pathway alone has negligible impact on overall spread, but if the proportion of risky sexual behavior increases then it may become important. Targeting mosquitoes remains the best approach of those considered. These results may be useful for public health organizations and governments to construct and implement suitable health policies and reduce the impact of the Zika outbreaks.","10.1371/journal.pone.0270127","Animals; Female; Humans; Aedes; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Mosquito Vectors; Sexual Behavior; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Symptoms are generally mild, such as fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis, but neurological complications, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, have been associated to this viral infection. During pregnancy, it can cause microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in the fetus, as well as pregnancy complications, representing a serious health threat. In this study, we show for the first time that Zika virus employs cell membrane lipid rafts as a portal of entry into Vero cells. We previously demonstrated that the antifungal drug Amphotericin B (AmphB) hampers a microbe-host cell interaction through the disruption of lipid raft architecture. Here, we found that Amphotericin B by the same mechanism of action inhibits both Zika virus cell entry and replication.

The control of these molecular programs exhibits sexually dimorphic characteristics that remain not sufficiently characterized. In the present study, we recorded genome-wide and sex-dependent early-phase transcriptional changes in regenerating (proximal) sciatic nerve 24 h after axotomy. Male nerves exhibited more extensive transcriptional changes with male-dominant upregulation of cytoskeletal binding and structural protein genes. Regulation of mRNAs encoding ion and ionotropic neurotransmitter channels displayed prominent sexual dimorphism consistent with sex-specific mRNA axonal transport in an early-phase regenerative response. Protein kinases and axonal transport genes showed sexually dimorphic regulation. Genes encoding components of synaptic vesicles were at high baseline expression in females and showed post-injury induction selectively in males. Predictive bioinformatic analyses established patterns of sexually dimorphic regulation of neurotrophic and immune genes, including activation of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor Gfra1 receptor and immune checkpoint cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) potentially linked to X-chromosome encoded tissue inhibitor of matrix metallo proteinases 1 (Timp1). Regulatory networks involving Olig1, Pou3f3/Oct6, Myrf, and Myt1l transcription factors were linked to sex-dependent reprogramming in regenerating nerves. Differential expression patterns of non-coding RNAs motivate a model of sexually dimorphic nerve regenerative responses to injury determined by epigenetic factors.

DM patients with diabetic neuropathy (DN) usually present with distal pain, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, postural hypotension, or erectile dysfunction. They also may present with other nerve pathologies such as inflammatory neuropathies and carpal tunnel syndrome. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the benefits of using sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is) to manage DN. An extensive systematic literature review was conducted to include all articles published up to 24 February 2022. All clinical studies included patients with DM and reported the outcomes of SGLT2I on diabetes-associated neuropathy. Six studies were identified for meta-analysis, including a total of 5312 diabetic patients. The average age of the included patients ranged from 41 to 74 years and 34-73 years in the SGLT2I treatment and control groups, respectively. SGLT2I moderately improved the manifestations of diabetic peripheral neuropathy events and nerve conduction velocity. Furthermore, the SGLT2I treatment group had a statistically significant higher mean heart-to-mediastinum ratio (MD 0.41; 95% 0.17, 0.64; p = 0.0006). However, the mean heart rates (MD -4.51; 95% -10.05, 1.04; p = 0.11) and wash out rates (MD 2.13; 95% -8.48, 12.75; p = 0.69) were not significantly different between the two groups. SGLT2Is could therefore be considered neuroprotective in patients with DN, possibly by considerably increasing the sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity, improving the clinical manifestations of DPN, and reducing sympathetic nervous system activity.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study of ESWT in oncology is carried out in two directions: 1) impact on the tumor with the aim of its disintegration, inhibition of growth, enhancement of the action of radiation and/or chemotherapy; 2) rehabilitation of cancer patients. Shock waves in vitro and in vivo significantly reduce the viability and activate apoptosis of cell lines of osteosarcoma, cancer of the stomach, colon, rectum, bladder, breast, urothelial cancer of the upper urinary tract, adenocarcinoma of the cervix, Burkitt's lymphoma, sarcoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer glands, glioblastoma multiforme. Shock waves also sensitize tumor cells for adjuvant chemotherapy and increase its antitumor activity. The lack of a stimulating effect on a number of malignant tumors in this physical factor makes it possible to conduct ESWT studies in the rehabilitation of cancer patients. The data obtained by a number of authors indicate the clinical efficacy of ESWT in the rehabilitation of patients with erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy, with postmastectomy lymphedema of the upper limb, with myofascial pain syndrome after cervical lymph node dissection due to malignant neoplasms of the head and neck, with peripheral polyneuropathy induced by cytostatics. However, in order to develop indications and contraindications for the appointment of ESWT in the rehabilitation of cancer patients, it is not enough just to evaluate its clinical effectiveness; currently absent scientific studies with long-term follow-up of patients who received this method of physiotherapy are needed.

We determined the overall quality of life (QoL) and identified its predictors among cervical cancer survivors after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on 153 disease-free cervical cancer survivors who completed curative treatment between January 2004 and December 2018 at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana. We used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core-30 item (EORTC QLQ-C30) and cervical cancer module (EORTC QLQ-CX24) to assess the survivors' overall QoL. QoL domain scores were dichotomised as affected or unaffected by disease and its treatment. Significant differences between the affected and unaffected groups within each QoL domain were determined using the student T-test. We used Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests to examine the difference in QoL domains between treatment types, with significance based on Bonferroni corrections. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of overall QoL. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The overall QoL score was 79.6 (SD 16.0), and 74.5% of survivors reported good QoL score within the median follow up time of 41.8 months (interquartile range [IQR], 25.5-71.1 months) after cervical cancer diagnosis. Although the majority (66.0-84.3%) of the QoL functioning scale were unaffected, about a fifth (22.2%) to a third (34.5%) of the subjects had perceptual impairment in cognitive and role functioning. Financial difficulties, peripheral neuropathy and pain were most common symptoms reported as affected. A third of the survivors were worried that sex would be painful, and 36.6% indicated that their sexual activity as affected. The overall QoL scores for survivors who had surgery, chemoradiation and radiation-alone were 86.1 (SD 9.7), 76.9 (SD 17.7), and 80.7 (SD 14.7), respectively (p = 0.025). The predictors of survivor's overall QoL were loss of appetite [Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR) = 9.34, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 2.13-35.8, p = 0.001], pain (AOR = 3.53, 95% CI = 1.25-9.31, p = 0.017) and body image (AOR = 5.89, 95% CI = 1.80-19.27, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: About 75% of the survivors had a good overall quality of life. Primary surgical treatment affords the best prospects for quality of life with the least symptom complaints and financial burden. Loss of appetite, pain or diminution in body image perception predicted the overall quality of life of cervical cancer survivors after treatment.","10.1371/journal.pone.0268831","Cancer Survivors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Ghana; Humans; Middle Aged; Pain; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survivors; Tertiary Care Centers; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","","Journal Article"
"35565474","Long-Term Survival, Prognostic Factors, and Quality of Life of Patients Undergoing Pelvic Exenteration for Cervical Cancer.","Stanca M; Căpîlna DM; Căpîlna ME","Cancers","2022","Background: Considerable efforts have been carried out over the past 30 years to support patients with advanced cervical cancer. Throughout this time, Eastern European countries have been left aside from the decision-making groups on this matter, hence the absence of similar studies in this geographical area. In these countries, the quality of life (QoL) of patients with cervical cancer might be considered a “caprice”, and the discomforts they encounter following pelvic exenteration for cervical cancer are often perceived as a “normal phenomenon”. Methods: This study examined forty-seven patients submitted to pelvic exenteration followed up for nine years after the surgical intervention. The first objective of this study is to identify the prognostic factors that influence the overall survival (OS) of patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for FIGO stage IVA, recurrent or persistent cervical cancer after previous conclusive treatments. The second objective is to assess the QoL of the surviving patients using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CX24 standardized questionnaires. Results: The mean age of the participants was 54 years (range 36−67). At the time of the study, there were 25 living patients (53.2%), the 3-year OS was 61%, and the 5-year OS was 48.7%. Cox regression analysis recognized parameter invasion, pelvic lymph node metastases, positive resection margins, early postoperative complications, and infralevatorian pelvic exenteration as negative prognostic factors influencing the OS (p < 0.05). Of the 25 survivors, 18 patients answered the QoL questionnaires. The cost of favorable survival has been translated into poor overall QoL, unsatisfactory functional, social, and symptom scores, a high prevalence of cervical cancer-specific symptoms such as lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, severe menopausal symptoms, distorted body image, and lack of sexual desire. The lower scores are comparable to the only three studies available in the literature that assessed the QoL of patients undergoing pelvic exenteration precisely for cervical cancer. Conclusions: Despite its retrospective nature and some limitations, this paper, similar to other studies, shows a decent OS but with a marked adverse impact on QoL, suggesting the importance of adequate psycho-emotional and financial support for these patients following pelvic exenteration. This study also contributes to the current knowledge regarding advanced cervical cancer treatment, depicting survival, prognostic factors, and QoL of patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for cervical cancer in a reference center in Eastern Europe. Our study can provide a comparison for future prospective randomized trials needed to confirm these results.","10.3390/cancers14092346","","QLQ-C30; QLQ-CX24; cervical cancer; pelvic exenteration; quality of life; survival","Journal Article"

GPR171 is a promising therapeutic target that is widely expressed through the brain, including within the descending pain modulatory regions. Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of the GPR171 agonist, MS15203, in its ability to alleviate chronic pain in male and female mice using a once-daily systemic dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.) of MS15203 over the course of 5 days. We found that in our models of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), MS15203 did not alleviate thermal hypersensitivity and allodynia, respectively, in female mice. On the other hand, MS15203 treatment decreased the duration of thermal hypersensitivity in CFA-treated male mice following 3 days of once-daily administration. MS15203 treatment also produced an improvement in allodynia in male mice, but not female mice, in neuropathic pain after 5 days of treatment. Gene expression of GPR171 and that of its endogenous ligand BigLEN, encoded by the gene PCSK1N, were unaltered within the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in both male and female mice following inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, following neuropathic pain in male mice, the protein levels of GPR171 were decreased in the PAG. Treatment with MS15203 then rescued the protein levels of GPR171 in the PAG of these mice. Taken together, our results identify GPR171 as a GPCR that displays sexual dimorphism in alleviation of chronic pain. Further, our results suggest that GPR171 and MS15203 have demonstrable therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic pain.","10.3389/fpain.2021.695396","","G-protein coupled receptor; inflammation; neuropathy; orphan receptor; sex difference","Journal Article"

It is mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, but infections are also linked to sexual transmissions. Infectious ZIKV has been isolated, and viral RNA has been detected in semen over a year after the onset of initial symptoms, but the mode of long-term persistence is not yet understood. ZIKV can proliferate in human Sertoli cells (HSerC) for several weeks in vitro, suggesting that it might be a reservoir for persistent ZIKV infection. This study determined proteomic changes in HSerC during ZIKV infections by TMT-mass spectrometry analysis. Levels of 4416 unique Sertoli cell proteins were significantly altered at 3, 5, and 7 days after ZIKV infection. The significantly altered proteins include enzymes, transcription regulators, transporters, kinases, peptidases, transmembrane receptors, cytokines, ion channels, and growth factors. Many of these proteins are involved in pathways associated with antiviral response, antigen presentation, and immune cell activation. Several immune response pathway proteins were significantly activated during infection, e.g., interferon signaling, T cell receptor signaling, IL-8 signaling, and Th1 signaling. The altered protein levels were linked to predicted activation of immune response in HSerC, which was predicted to suppress ZIKV infection. ZIKV infection also affected the levels of critical regulators of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis pathways such as phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase. Interestingly, many significantly altered proteins were associated with cardiac hypertrophy, which may induce heart failure in infected patients. In summary, our research contributes to a better understanding of ZIKV replication dynamics and infection in Sertoli cells.","10.3390/v14020377","Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cardiovascular Diseases; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Male; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteomics; RNA, Viral; Semen; Sertoli Cells; Virus Replication; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Sertoli cells; Zika virus; carbohydrate metabolism; cardiovascular disease; glycolysis; immune response; persistence in semen; sexual transmission","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

AIM: To investigate the effect of GJG on L-OHP-induced ED in rats. METHODS: Twelve-week-old male Wister/ST rats were categorized into the following groups: Sham, Sham+GJG, L-OHP, and L-OHP+GJG (each n = 10). The L-OHP and L-OHP+GJG groups were injected intravenously with L-OHP (4 mg/kg) for 2 consecutive days in the first week. Statistical significance was determined using Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. OUTCOMES: At the end of the study period, erectile function was evaluated by measuring intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) after cavernous nerve stimulation. Western blot analysis was used to assess the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the expression of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-1. RESULTS: The ICP/MAP ratio of L-OHP rats (0.34 ± 0.06) was significantly lower than that of Sham rats (0.67 ± 0.03, P < .01), however, the ICP/MAP ratio of L-OHP+GJG rats (0.55 ± 0.01) was significantly higher than that of L-OHP rats (P < .01). There were no significant differences in the nNOS and eNOS protein expression between both groups (P > .05). GJG administration significantly decreased PDE-5 and NADPH oxidase-1 messenger RNA expressions in the L-OHP+GJG group. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: This animal model study suggests that GJG might be effective for erectile function in cancer survivors. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Our study identified that GJG had no notable side effects in the treated group. Further investigation of the cavernous nerve would also help elucidate the mechanism of GJG effect, which is a limitation of this study. CONCLUSION: We found that GJG administration improved L-OHP-induced ED by improving transcriptional PDE-5 expression. Kataoka T, Kawaki Y, Kito Y, et al.

In Eastern European developing countries, the health care system often cannot afford the uppermost standardized treatment for these patients. In the absence of a comparable study in our country, the authors' aim for this retrospective cross-sectional observational study was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and the QoL o cervical cancer survivors; (2) Methods: 430 patients were analyzed. The first objective is to evaluate the OS rates of patients with cervical cancer stages IA2 to IIB undergoing radical hysterectomy (RH) +/- neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiotherapy +/- chemoradiotherapy treatment combinations. The second objective is to assess their QoL, using two standardized questionnaires issued by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), namely QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CX24. (3) Results: The mean age of the participants was 51 years (22-76) and the average follow-up time was 65 months (2-128). At the time of the analysis, 308 out of 430 patients were alive, with a mean five-year OS of 72.4%. The multivariate Cox regression analysis identified stage IIB, parametrial invasion, and the lymph node metastases as independent prognostic risk factors negatively impacting the OS. Of the 308 patients still alive at the time of the analysis, 208 (68%) answered the QoL questionnaires. The QLQ-C30 shows a good long-term Global QoL of 64.6 (median), good functioning scores, and a decent symptom scale value. However, the EORTC QLQ-CX24 showed high values of cervical cancer-specific symptoms, namely: lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, severe menopausal symptoms, and distorted body-image perception. The results also indicate a significant decline in the quality of sexual life with a low sexual enjoyment and decreased level of sexual activities. (4) Conclusion: Despite a good OS, in this setting of patients, cervical cancer survivors have a modest QoL and sexual function.

As little is known about the aetiology and clinical context of this complaint, this study investigated the relationship between vaginal dryness and other clinical parameters associated with pSS. METHODS: Female participants of the REgistry of Sjögren syndrome at UMCG - LongiTudinal (RESULT) cohort who fulfilled ACR-EULAR and/or AECG classification criteria for pSS were included, using baseline data for analyses. Patient-reported vaginal dryness (range 0-10) was correlated with demographic characteristics, systemic disease activity (i.e., ESSDAI), Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Damage Index, salivary and lacrimal gland function, patient-reported outcomes (ESSPRI, MFI), serology and quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D). Significantly associated parameters (p<0.05) were corrected for potential confounders. RESULTS: This cross-sectional study included 199 women with pSS; mean age was 52±14 years, 53% were postmenopausal, and median vaginal dryness score was 5 (IQR 2-7). Vaginal dryness was significantly associated with older age, postmenopausal status, peripheral neuropathy, oral and ocular dryness, ESSPRI and SF-36 mental and general health. After correction for age, menopausal status and medication use, peripheral neuropathy (B=1.632), oral dryness (B=0.302), and ocular dryness (B=0.230) were independently associated with vaginal dryness. CONCLUSIONS: The independent association of vaginal dryness with oral and ocular dryness might imply that the aetiology of these symptoms is partly shared. Of all extraglandular features, only peripheral neuropathy was independently associated with vaginal dryness, suggesting that peripheral neuropathy plays a significant role in the pathology of vaginal dryness in pSS.","10.55563/clinexprheumatol/hzveng","Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Sjogren's Syndrome","","Journal Article"

METHODS: This study utilised a mixed methods sequential explanatory design. Adult CRC survivors between 6- and 60-months post-diagnosis (n = 304) were purposively recruited from three hospitals and twenty-one cancer support centres in Ireland. QoL was evaluated using the EuroQol and FACT-C questionnaires and results compared to population norms. 22 survey participants took part in semi-structured interviews exploring the impact of survivorship issues on their daily lives. RESULTS: While CRC survivors reported QoL outcomes comparable to or better than normative populations, 54% were dissatisfied with their QoL. The most common survivorship issues reported included negative body image (74%), fatigue (68%), sexual dysfunction (66%) and sleep disturbance (59%). Thematic analysis of the qualitative data illustrated survivors' attempts to live with the impact of cancer and its treatment (loss, fear, impact) and striving to contextualise, reframe and understand the consequences of cancer and its treatment (control, vigilance, benefit). Within these themes, the cross-domain impact of less prevalent symptoms including bowel dysfunction (28-57%) and peripheral neuropathy (47%) were widely discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Although cancer survivors report positive QoL outcomes, many experience distressing physical, psychological and social effects. The findings suggest less common and difficult to manage symptoms are the greatest source of distress and unmet need. Support and information must be tailored to address survivors' individual needs and preferences for support, informed by holistic person-centred assessment.","10.1007/s11136-021-02975-2","Adult; Cancer Survivors; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Survivorship","Cancer survivorship; Colorectal cancer; Integration; Mixed methods; Patient reported outcomes","Journal Article"

Nevertheless, significant knowledge gaps regarding the outcome of a mass vaccination strategy exist and must be addressed. Zika virus circulates in flavivirus-endemic regions, an ideal Zika vaccine should avoid the potential of antibody-dependent enhancement from exposure to dengue virus. Prevention of CZS is the primary goal for immunization, and the vaccine must provide protection against intrauterine transmission for use during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age. Ideally, a vaccine should also prevent sexual transmission of the virus through mucosal protection.Expert opinion: This review describes current vaccine approaches against Zika virus with particular attention to the application of virus-like particle (VLP) technology as a strategy for solving the challenges of Zika virus immunization.","10.1080/14760584.2021.1945447","Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Technology; Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle; Viral Vaccines; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Vaccine; antibody-dependent enhancement; clinical trial; congenital zika syndrome; flavivirus; immunization; mucosal protection; virus-like particle; vlp; zika virus","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

This systematic review aims to summarise patient-reported outcome (PRO) data concerning health-related quality of life, functional impacts and common side-effects of treatments for testicular cancer. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline OVID, CINAHL, PubMed, Embase and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Over Time In Oncology (PROMOTION) databases from inception to 25 March 2020, using ""testicular cancer"" and ""PRO"" search terms developed in conjunction with a medical librarian. Two authors screened abstracts and full-text articles for studies that reported primary PRO data related to the treatment of testicular cancer including at least 50 participants. We excluded psychosocial data as this was included in our companion review. Data were extracted by three reviewers, and quality was assessed by two reviewers using QUAL-SYST. Studies with a quality of score over 65% were included in our narrative synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 1831 records were identified via our database searches and 41 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 35 included participants who had chemotherapy. Twenty-eight different PRO measures were used across the 41 studies. Of the 41 studies, 29 had quality scores over 65% and were included in our narrative synthesis. We found that chemotherapy was generally associated with a higher side-effect burden than other treatments, and higher burden was associated with higher doses of chemotherapy. Hearing problems, peripheral neuropathy, and Raynaud's phenomena were particularly common side-effects. Problems with sexual functioning were associated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. DISCUSSION: While many studies found that between-treatment differences resolved within the first 12 months since diagnosis, there were many long-term and dose-dependent impacts associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy across PRO domains. Offering information about these aspects, and information about expected survival outcomes, will help inform, prepare, and empower patients to make decisions about treatment aligned with their preferences and personal situations.","10.2147/PROM.S242754","","cancer survivorship; patient-reported outcomes; quality of life; testicular cancer","Journal Article; Review"

METHODS: QoL was measured at baseline and at every end of two cycles, for the median of 8 cycles among 146 breast cancer women on AC and AC-T chemotherapy, using EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 instruments. The effect of QoL score, socio-demographic, and clinical variables at baseline were adjusted for the effect of chemotherapy's toxicities on QoL. RESULTS: Overall QoL, all functional scales (except cognitive functioning, body image, future perspectives, and sexual functioning) and symptom scales (except dyspnea, insomnia, pain score, arm, and breast symptoms) of EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 deteriorated significantly both clinically and statistically, in particular, during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. After the end of cycle 2 or 4, except for cognitive, social functioning, and financial difficulties of the patients, almost all other QoL dimensions were improved towards pretreatment score by the end of cycle 8. In addition to age, educational status, and tumor stage, the Global Health Status (-10.55≤B≤-7.71, P≤0.013), and the functional scales (-25.320≤B≤-6.351, P≤0.033) of EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 were significantly affected at least by one of the AC and AC-T chemotherapy's toxicity such as grade≥2 fatigue, dysgeusia, constipation, dry mouth, vomiting, oral mucositis, skin hyperpigmentation and/or peripheral neuropathy than their lower grade. Grade≥2 fatigue, dysgeusia, oral mucositis, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, anemia arthralgia/myalgia, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, and/or skin hyperpigmentation were positively predicted for the deterioration of symptoms scale of EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 (4.819≤B≤26.451, P≤0.043). CONCLUSION: Quality of life among Ethiopian breast cancer patients on AC and AC-T regimens significantly deteriorated particularly during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. In addition to the age, tumor stage and educational status of the patients, grade≥2 fatigue, dysgeusia, constipation, oral mucositis, dry mouth, peripheral neuropathy, and skin hyperpigmentation due to AC and AC-T chemotherapy were frequently associated with deterioration of different scales/items QoL.

Presence or absence of patient- (PRO-CTCAE) or clinician-reported symptomatic AEs were compared (kappa) at defined timepoints and overall (BL+ mid-cycle 1 + C2). RESULTS: Of 292 patients approached from May 2017 to January 2019, a total of 265 (90.8%) were consented, with 243 (91.7%) evaluable and 552 PRO-CTCAE surveys (completion rate = 98.7%) included in analyses. Evaluation of overall patient-reported symptomatic AEs identified 50 PRO-CTCAE and 11 CTCAE items with 10% or greater reporting frequency. Nineteen CTCAE items were reported as 1% or less despite matched PRO-CTCAE items reporting as 10% or greater. Underreported categories included sexual health, bodily emissions, and cognition. Clinician- relative to patient-reporting frequency (ratio) demonstrated 9 symptomatic AEs with a 50-fold or more lower clinician reporting rate. Overall patient-clinician agreement for individual symptomatic AEs ranged from poor (κ = 0.00-0.19) to moderate (κ = 0.40-0.59), with discordance driven by lack of clinician reporting. Dyspnea (κ = 0.54) and peripheral neuropathy (κ = 0.63) at BL and limb edema (κ = 0.55) at C2 demonstrated the highest patient-clinician agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Poor to moderate patient-clinician agreement for symptomatic AEs suggests clinician underreporting in phase I trials. Analyses of severity and interference PRO categories are ongoing.","10.1093/jnci/djab015","Antineoplastic Agents; Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic; Cognition; Humans; Neoplasms; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires","","Journal Article; Observational Study"

Much of our knowledge on health problems and infectious encountered by international travellers has evolved as a result of GeoSentinel surveillance, providing geographic and temporal trends in morbidity among travellers while contributing to improved pre-travel advice. We set out to synthesize epidemiological information, clinical manifestations and time trends for dengue, chikungunya and Zika in travellers as captured by GeoSentinel. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed on international travellers who presented with dengue, chikungunya or Zika virus infections to GeoSentinel sites around the world from 1995 until 2020. RESULTS: Of 107 GeoSentinel publications, 42 articles were related to dengue, chikungunya and/or Zika. The final analyses and synthesis of and results presented here are based on the findings from 27 original articles covering the three arboviral diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue is the most frequent arboviral disease encountered in travellers presenting to GeoSentinel sites, with increasing trends over the past two decades. In Southeast Asia, annual proportionate morbidity increased from 50 dengue cases per 1000 ill returned travellers in non-epidemic years to an average of 159 cases per 1000 travellers during epidemic years. The highest number of travellers with chikungunya virus infections was reported during the chikungunya outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean in the years 2013-16. Zika was first reported by GeoSentinel already in 2012, but notifications peaked in the years 2016-17 reflecting the public health emergency in the Americas at the time.","10.1093/jtm/taaa222","Americas; Asia, Southeastern; Caribbean Region; Chikungunya Fever; Dengue; Humans; Population Surveillance; Travel-Related Illness; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Guillain–Barré syndrome; Travel; autochthonous transmission; congenital Zika syndrome; importation; sexual transmission; systematic review","Journal Article; Systematic Review"

The prevalence increases with age. Basic and clinical research is identifying the neurovascular and humoral control of the mechanisms. The initial evaluation should differentiate erectile dysfunction from premature ejaculation and loss of libido. Myocardial insufficiency, hypogonadism and peripheral neuropathy should be looked for. Initial laboratory investigations should be restricted to identifying previously undetected medical illness that may directly contribute to erectile dysfunction. Discussing the available options with the couple is an important aspect. If erectile dysfunction is secondary to other treatable disorders these should be treated simultaneously. When other diseases that require intervention are ruled out and if there are no contraindications, therapy may be initiated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In selected cases, psychosexual therapy may be beneficial. If phosphodiesterase inhibitors are contraindicated, vacuum constriction devices may be tried. Further options include intracavernosal injection, intraurethral instillation, penile revascularization and prosthesis. The availability of effective and well-tolerated oral medications has dramatically changed the clinical approach to erectile dysfunction. Pharmacotherapy is the preferred cost-effective first-line therapy in the vast majority of patients. A stepped-care approach is followed in the primary care and family practice settings. Appropriate urological, endocrine and psychiatric referrals, and shared decision-making with the couple will enable effective treatment of men with erectile dysfunction.",NA,"Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; India; Male; Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors; Prevalence; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article; Review"

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess of the prevalence and risk factors associated with FSD in Romanian women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (CAT). METHODS: The study sample included 104 Romanian women with both T1DM and CAT, and 101 Romanian matched controls with only T1DM. The presence of FSD was established using two validated tests: The Female Sexual Function Index and the Female Sexual Distress Scale-revised. The presence of depression was assessed using Beck's Depression Inventory-II. RESULTS: We found that almost half of the women in the group with T1DM and CAT presented with sexual dysfunction (49 vs. 33.7% in the control group; p = 0.025): 27.9 vs. 8.9 (p < 0.001)-desire, 23.1 vs. 7.9% (p = 0.003)-orgasm, 21.2 vs. 5.9% (p = 0.002)-lubrication, 17.3 vs. 6.9% (p = 0.023)-arousal, 9.6 vs. 1% (p = 0.006)-pain, and 20.2 vs. 9.9% (p = 0.040)-satisfaction problems. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that age was a significant risk factor for FSD, along with DM and body mass index. Coexisting CAT, polyneuropathy, depression, and the use of insulin pumps were significant risk factors for FSD. CONCLUSIONS: Women with T1DM and CAT are more likely to present with FSD than those without. It is important for patients to address depression, if present, and exercise caution while using insulin pumps. Moreover, DM complications such as polyneuropathy are significant risk factors for FSD; thus, it is crucial to ensure satisfactory glycemic control and optimal DM management.","10.1186/s13098-020-00602-7","","Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis; Depression; Female sexual dysfunction; Insulin pump; Polyneuropathy; Type 1 diabetes mellitus","Journal Article"

Erectile dysfunction threatens the well-being of clients, hence determining its risk factors and controlling it at an early stage is vital to preventing serious consequences and the burden of the disease. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically evaluate erectile dysfunction risk factors in patients with diabetes mellitus in Africa. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, African Journals Online, Wiley Online Library and Google Scholar were searched and complemented by manual searches. Egger's regression test was used to determine publication bias. The I2 statistic was used to check heterogeneity between the studies. DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was applied to estimate pooled effect size, odds ratios, and 95% confidence interval across studies. STATA version 14 statistical software was used for the meta-analysis. RESULT: Overall, 17 studies with 6002 study participants were included to identify risk factors of erectile dysfunction among diabetic patients.

Accumulation of the unhydrolyzed substrate glucosylceramide within lysosomes results in progressive, multisystem Gaucher disease, classified into three types. Both parkinsonism and peripheral neuropathy are observed in cases of putative non-neuronopathic type 1 disease. In the current study we investigated whether the peripheral neural response in type 1 Gaucher disease patients, with no neural manifestations is conditioned by the influence of sex hormones. METHODS: The catalytic activity of b-glucocerebrosidase in peripheral blood leukocytes was determined spectrofluorometrically. Direct sequencing of the GBA1 gene was performed. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded after electrical stimulation of the median nerve of both arms. Stimuli of 0.2 ms duration at a frequency of 5 Hz were used. Sex hormones were determined by radioimmunoassay using a gamma scintillation counter. RESULTS: Analysis of the somatosensory evoked potentials revealed significant differences in peak latencies on periphery between men and women in both control and type 1 Gaucher disease groups. Analysis by gender showed significant associations between latencies and sex hormones only in female patients: negative correlation between oestradiol concentration and N9 peak latency, and a strong negative correlation of testosterone levels with all peak latencies on the periphery (N9-N13). CONCLUSIONS: A relationship between testosterone concentrations and the latencies of potentials evoked on peripheral nerves exists only in females with type 1 Gaucher disease. We point out sexual dimorphism in the development of this entity.

Nagomilavanje nehidrolizovanog supstrata glukozilceramida u lizozomima dovodi do progresivne, multisistemske Gošeove bolesti klasifikovane u tri tipa. Ispostavilo se da se kod obavezno ne-neuronopatskog tipa 1 ipak javlja neuralna patologija - parkinsonizam i periferna neuropatija. U aktuelnoj studiji, istraživali smo da li je kod pacijenata sa Gošeovom bolešću tipa 1 koji su bez ikakvih neuroloških manifestacija periferni neuralni odgovor uslovljen uticajem polnih hormona. METODE: Katalitička aktivnost b-glikocerebrozidaze u leukocitima periferne krvi utvrđena je spektrofluorometrijskim metodom. Analiza gena GBA1 izvedena je direktnim sekvenciranjem. Snimljeni su somatosenzorni potencijali evocirani električnom stimulacijom nervusa medijanusa obe ruke. Nadražajima trajanja 0,2 ms delovalo se frekvecijom od 5 Hz. Polni hormoni su mereni radioimunološkim metodom pomoću gama scintilacionog brojača. REZULTATI: Metodom somatosenzornih evociranih potencijala otkrili smo značajnu razliku u latencama kod muškaraca i žena na periferiji, kako u kontrolnoj grupi tako i u grupi Gošeove bolesti tipa 1. Analiza po polu pokazuje značajne korelacije između latenci i polnih hormona samo kod ženskih pacijenata: značajno negativnu korelaciju između koncentracije estradiola i latence N9, i jaku negativnu korelaciju nivoa testosterona sa svim latencama na periferiji (N9-N13). ZAKLJUČAK: Dokazom da povezanost koncentracija testosterona i latenci potencijala izazvanih na perifernim živcima postoji samo kod žena sa tipom 1 Gošeove bolesti ukazujemo na seksualni dimorfizam u razvoju toga entiteta.","10.2478/jomb-2019-0020","","Type 1 Gaucher disease; latencies; oestradiol; somatosensory evoked potentials; testosterone","Journal Article"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven patients who were diagnosed as having ovarian cancer and treated between January 2005 and June 2010 with an expected survival time of at least 3 months, were enrolled into the study. The exclusion criteria were diagnoses of any disease that could disrupt consciousness and concurrent malignancies. The EORTC QLQ-OV28 module was translated into Turkish by professional translators and physicians. The test-retest reliability of the Turkish version of the questionnaire was performed on 30 patients. Answers were scored according to the instructions provided by the EORTC. The total score was calculated as explained above and after scoring procedures, all subscale scores were linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale. All patients concomitantly completed the Spielberg State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Patients were analyzed in two groups: on-treatment and off-treatment groups consisted of patients who did and did not undergo chemotherapy or surgery within the last two months, respectively. The demographic data of all patients were recorded. EORTC QLQ-OV28 scores of both groups were compared. Correlations between EORTC QLQ-OV28 subscales and total score of BDI and STAI were analyzed. RESULTS: For test-retest reliability, Spearman's rho was 0.84 (p<0.001). The on-treatment group scored statistically significantly higher than the offtreatment group in peripheral neuropathies, attitude to disease and treatment, sexual function and other chemotherapy adverse effect subscales of the questionnaire. Correlations between EORTC QLQ-OV28 subscales and the total scores of BDI and STAI of the groups were statistically significant, except the sexual function subscale. CONCLUSION: The Turkish translated version of EORTC QLQ-OV28 module is a reliable, consistent, and a valid instrument for assessing the impact of treatment modalities on QoL among Turkish speaking women with ovarian cancer.","10.4274/tjod.galenos.2020.26594","","EORTC; Quality of life; ovarian cancer","Journal Article"

The impact of both treatment arms on quality of life is reported in the present study. METHODS: Patients completed the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire QLQ-C30 and CX24 before treatment and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment. Linear mixed models were fitted to analyze differences in quality of life over time and between groups. Differences in mean quality of life scales >10 points and p<0.05 were considered clinically relevant and statistically significant, respectively. Inclusion criteria were: (1) histological diagnosis of locally advanced invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages IIB-IVA; (2) signed informed consent to participate in the CIRCE trial; and (3) answered at least one quality of life questionnaire. Excluded were patients who did not complete any quality of life questionnaire. Relevant exclusion criteria for the CIRCE trial included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >2 and peripheral neuropathy >2. Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to assess differences between groups in quality of life at baseline. To evaluate differences between treatment arms, linear mixed models were fitted using the transformed quality of life scores as a dependent variable and time of follow-up and study arm as factors. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were enrolled (n=55 neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm; n=52 chemoradiation arm). Quality of life compliance rates were higher for the chemoradiation group at every assessment time (ranging from 75-86.5% in the chemoradiation arm vs 55-81.8% in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm). For quality of life results at baseline, no statistically significant difference between the groups was seen. For both groups, most scales showed improvements over time, except for worsening of the summary score, sexual enjoyment, peripheral neuropathy, and menopausal symptoms. For chemoradiation, body image was lower (p<0.001) and patients presented more lymphedema (p<0.001) and sexual worry (p<0.001) at 12 months compared with baseline. Comparing study arms, neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed significantly lower scores in the menopausal symptoms scale (p=0.03) and higher scores for sexual/vaginal functioning (p=0.01). At 12 months, clinical differences were seen only for body image and menopausal symptoms scale, with neoadjuvant chemotherapy presenting better body image scores and a lower burden of menopausal symptoms. CONCLUSION: After treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer, patients improved in most quality of life aspects. However, worsening was observed in sexual enjoyment, peripheral neuropathy, and menopausal symptoms. To improve patients' quality of life, efforts should be made to prevent and treat these long term effects of locally advanced cervical cancer treatment.","10.1136/ijgc-2019-001134","Adult; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Carcinoma; Chemoradiotherapy; Cisplatin; Deoxycytidine; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Quality of Life; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Gemcitabine","quality of life (PRO)/palliative care; uterine cervical neoplasms","Clinical Trial, Phase II; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial"

Previous studies have primarily focused on how baseline cardiac characteristics affect mortality, but the impact of non-cardiac baseline characteristics is less defined. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed/Medline (1990-2019) to identify studies that assessed the impact of baseline ATTR-PN characteristics on survival. Outcomes were first summarized descriptively. Extracted survival data were then disaggregated, and parametric mixture models were used to assess survival differences among patient groups defined by factors known to affect survival. RESULTS: The search yielded 1193 records, of which 35 were retained for analysis. Median survival ranged from 0.5 to > 25 years. The largest survival differences were between cohorts who underwent liver transplantation (LTx) versus those who did not. Among LTx cohorts, pre-LTx ATTR-PN disease duration ≥ 7 years, poor nutritional status, and late disease onset reduced median survival by 13, 12, and 10 years, respectively. Other prognostic survival factors included non-Val30Met genotype and baseline presence of urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or muscle weakness. CONCLUSION: Survival in patients with ATTR-PN is highly variable and affected by non-cardiac baseline characteristics, such as autonomic dysfunction, large fiber involvement, late-onset disease, and non-Val30Met mutation. Careful interpretation of these findings is warranted given that this synthesis did not control for differences between studies.

Most patients are referred for mental-health treatment, but as research suggests associations with neurological symptoms and conditions, there is need to analyze cases comprehensively evaluated by neurologists. METHODS: The IRB waived consent requirements for this retrospective university-hospital study. We extracted and analyzed neurological symptoms, test, and treatment results from all qualifying participants' records and recontacted some for details. RESULTS: All 10 participants were female; their PGAD symptoms began between ages 11 to 70 years. Two patterns emerged: 80% reported daily out-of-context sexual arousal episodes (≤30/day) that usually included orgasm and 40% reported lesser, often longer-lasting, nonorgasmic arousals. Most also had symptoms consistent with sacral neuropathy-70% had urologic complaints and 60% had neuropathic perineal or buttock pain. In 90% of patients, diagnostic testing identified anatomically appropriate and plausibly causal neurological lesions. Sacral dorsal-root Tarlov cysts were most common (in 4), then sensory polyneuropathy (2). One had spina bifida occulta and another drug-withdrawal effect as apparently causal; lumbosacral disc herniation was suspected in another. Neurological treatments cured or significantly improved PGAD symptoms in 4/5 patients, including 2 cures. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by small size and referral bias to neurologists, this series strengthens associations with Tarlov cysts and sensory polyneuropathy and suggests new ones. We hypothesize that many cases of PGAD are caused by unprovoked firing of C-fibers in the regional special sensory neurons that subserve sexual arousal. Some PGAD symptoms may share pathophysiologic mechanisms with neuropathic pain and itch.","10.1097/PR9.0000000000000801","","C-fibers; Neuropathic pain; Pelvic pain; Peripheral neuropathy; Spinal cord; Tarlov cysts","Journal Article"

Little research exists on CRC symptoms or symptom management guidelines to support these individuals after cancer treatments. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to systematically review symptom experiences, risk factors, and the impact of symptoms and to examine the pooled frequency and severity of symptoms via meta-analyses in CRC survivors after cancer treatments. METHODS: Relevant studies were systematically searched in 7 databases from 2009 to 2019. Meta-analysis was conducted for pooled estimates of symptom frequency and severity. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. Six studies assessed multiple CRC symptoms, whereas 29 focused on a single symptom, including peripheral neuropathy, psychological distress, fatigue, body image distress, cognitive impairment, and insomnia. The pooled mean frequency was highest for body image distress (78.5%). On a scale of 0 to 100, the pooled mean severity was highest for fatigue (50.1). Gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and insomnia were also major problems in CRC survivors. Multiple factors contributed to adverse symptoms, such as younger age, female gender, and lack of family/social support. Symptoms negatively impacted quality of life, social and sexual functioning, financial status, and caregivers' physical and mental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer survivors experienced multiple adverse symptoms related to distinct risk factors. These symptoms negatively impacted patients and caregivers' well-being. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare providers can use study findings to better assess and monitor patient symptoms after cancer treatments.

Many health disorders in male patients affect sexual activity by directly causing erectile dysfunction, affecting sexual motivation, or both. Clinical evidence indicates that many diseases strongly disrupt sexual motivation and sexual performance in patients with depression, addiction, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disturbances with obesity and diet-related factors, kidney and liver failure, circadian rhythm disorders, sleep disturbances including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, developmental and hormonal disorders, brain damages, cardiovascular diseases, and peripheral neuropathies. Preclinical studies of these conditions often require appropriate experimental paradigms, including animal models. Male sexual behavior and motivation have been intensively investigated over the last 80 years in animal rat model. Sexual motivation can be examined using such parameters as: anticipatory behavior and 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations reflecting the emotional state of rats, initiation of copulation, efficiency of copulation, or techniques of classical (pavlovian) and instrumental conditioning. In this review article, we analyze the behavioral parameters that describe the sexual motivation and sexual performance of male rats in the context of animal experimental models of human health disorders. Based on analysis of the parameters describing the heterogeneous and complex structure of sexual behavior in laboratory rodents, we propose an approach that is useful for delineating distinct mechanisms affecting sexual motivation and sexual performance in selected disease states and the efficacy of therapy in preclinical investigations.","10.3389/fnbeh.2019.00257","","anxiety; depression; general arousal; male behavior; metabolic disorders; sexual arousal; sexual motivation; ultrasonic vocalizations","Journal Article; Review"

Additionally, the involvement of pregnant women makes the drug screening process lengthy and complicated in terms of safety and minimum toxicity of the molecules. Since NS3 helicase of ZIKV performs the critical function of unwinding double-stranded RNA during replication, it is considered as a promising drug target to block ZIKV replication. In the present study, we have exploited the NTPase site of ZIKV NS3 helicase for screening potential inhibitor compounds by molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches. NS3 helicase hydrolyzes the ATP to use its energy for unwinding RNA. We have chosen twenty natural compounds from ZINC library with known antiviral properties and a helicase focused library (HFL) of small molecules from Life Chemicals compounds. After going through docking, the top hit molecules from ZINC and HFL library were further analysed by MD simulations to find out stable binding poses. Finally, we have reported the molecules with potential of binding at NTPase pocket of ZIKV NS3 helicase, which could be further tested on virus through in vitro experiments to check their efficacy.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Although ZIKV was mainly transmitted by mosquito bites, many sexual transmission cases have been reported since the outbreak in 2015. ZIKV can persist in testis and semen for a long time, causing testicular tissue damage and reducing sperm quality. However, no drug has been approved for prevention or treatment of ZIKV infection, especially infection in male testicular tissue. Previously reported peptide Z2 could inactivate ZIKV, inhibiting ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, Z2 could inhibit vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice, reducing ZIKV infection in fetus. Here we showed that intraperitoneally administered Z2 could also be distributed to testis and epididymis, resulting in the reduction of ZIKV RNA copies in testicular tissue and protection of testis and epididymis against ZIKV-induced pathological damage and poor sperm quality in type I interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice. Thus, Z2, a ZIKV inactivator, could serve as an antiviral agent for treatment of ZIKV infection and attenuation of ZIKV-induced testicular tissue damage.","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02250","","Zika virus; inactivator; peptide; sperm; testicular tissue damage","Journal Article"

Clinical practice","2019","BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improve patient's outcome. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common complication of hATTR amyloidosis. However, because CTS is also common in the general population, we wanted to assess whether CTS, when associated with systemic manifestations, could help direct physicians to screen for TTR gene mutation and early diagnosis. METHODS: We reviewed the charts and interviewed the patients with hATTR seen between 2017 and 2018. We noted the details of CTS diagnosis, treatment, and other systemic features of the disease. RESULTS: Seventeen of the 23 patients studied had CTS. CTS was the first manifestation of the disease in 10 of 17 patients. On average, CTS symptoms occurred 10.4 years before their diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis. In 6 of 10 patients with CTS, the following systemic symptoms were present as the first manifestation: erectile dysfunction, dysautonomia, polyneuropathy, exercise intolerance, and gastrointestinal and ocular symptoms. CONCLUSION: CTS occurs in most patients with hATTR amyloidosis and frequently precedes the hATTR diagnosis. Most patients with CTS preceding hATTR diagnosis have systemic features. Recognizing systemic features at the time of CTS presentation may help in early diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis.","10.1212/CPJ.0000000000000640","","","Journal Article"
"31480297","Therapeutic Advances Against ZIKV: A Quick Response, a Long Way to Go.","Saiz JC","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)","2019","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that spread throughout the American continent in 2015 causing considerable worldwide social and health alarm due to its association with ocular lesions and microcephaly in newborns, and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) cases in adults. Nowadays, no licensed vaccines or antivirals are available against ZIKV, and thus, in this very short time, the scientific community has conducted enormous efforts to develop vaccines and antivirals. So that, different platforms (purified inactivated and live attenuated viruses, DNA and RNA nucleic acid based candidates, virus-like particles, subunit elements, and recombinant viruses) have been evaluated as vaccine candidates. Overall, these vaccines have shown the induction of vigorous humoral and cellular responses, the decrease of viremia and viral RNA levels in natural target organs, the prevention of vertical and sexual transmission, as well as that of ZIKV-associated malformations, and the protection of experimental animal models. Some of these vaccine candidates have already been assayed in clinical trials. Likewise, the search for antivirals have also been the focus of recent investigations, with dozens of compounds tested in cell culture and a few in animal models. Both direct acting antivirals (DAAs), directed to viral structural proteins and enzymes, and host acting antivirals (HAAs), directed to cellular factors affecting all steps of the viral life cycle (binding, entry, fusion, transcription, translation, replication, maturation, and egress), have been evaluated. It is expected that this huge collaborative effort will produce affordable and effective therapeutic and prophylactic tools to combat ZIKV and other related still unknown or nowadays neglected flaviviruses. Here, a comprehensive overview of the advances made in the development of therapeutic measures against ZIKV and the questions that still have to be faced are summarized.","10.3390/ph12030127","","Zika virus; direct acting antivirals (DAAs); host acting antivirals (HAAs); vaccines","Journal Article; Review"

Therefore, before starting a rehabilitative exercise program, the pain has to be reduced to enable the patient to participate actively in the exercise program. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT, the application of radial and/or focused shock waves with low or high energy) has been shown to be effective and efficient in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. However, one historical paradigm was the fact that, in the past, cancer was seen as a contraindication for the use of ESWT. METHODS: Clinical note to present indications, benefits, and contraindications of shock wave treatment in cancer patients. RESULTS: Malignant tumors in the treatment area have to be seen as a contraindication for the use of ESWT treatment. Cancer itself-in the form of the underlying disease-is not a contraindication for the treatment with radial and focused shock wave therapy with low or high energy. Plantar fasciitis and calcaneal spurs, calcified shoulder, tennis elbow or Achilles tendinopathy, and delayed healing and chronic wounds are typical approved standard indications for ESWT, and are allowed when the malignant tumor is not in the treatment area. There are also other musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal indications (e.g., myofascial syndrome, erectile dysfunction, polyneuropathy, and lymphedema) that are relevant for cancer survivors. These indications are recommended by the International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST) for ""common empirically tested clinical use"" and as exceptional indications/expert indications.

Enkephalins/ACTH are derived from pro-enkephalin, pro-dynorphin or pro-opiomelanocortin precursors and, via opioid and melanocortin receptors, are responsible for many biological activities. Enkephalins exhibit the highest affinity for the δ receptor, followed by the μ and κ receptors, whereas ACTH binds to the five subtypes of melanocortin receptor, and is the only member of the melanocortin family of peptides that binds to the melanocortin-receptor 2 (ACTH receptor). Enkephalins/ACTH and their receptors exhibit a widespread anatomical distribution. Enkephalins are involved in analgesia, angiogenesis, blood pressure, embryonic development, emotional behavior, feeding, hypoxia, limbic system modulation, neuroprotection, peristalsis, and wound repair; as well as in hepatoprotective, motor, neuroendocrine and respiratory mechanisms. ACTH plays a role in acetylcholine release, aggressive behavior, blood pressure, bone maintenance, hyperalgesia, feeding, fever, grooming, learning, lipolysis, memory, nerve injury repair, neuroprotection, sexual behavior, sleep, social behavior, tissue growth and stimulates the synthesis and secretion of glucocorticoids. Enkephalins/ACTH are also involved in many pathologies. Enkephalins are implicated in alcoholism, cancer, colitis, depression, heart failure, Huntington's disease, influenza A virus infection, ischemia, multiple sclerosis, and stress. ACTH plays a role in Addison's disease, alcoholism, cancer, Cushing's disease, dermatitis, encephalitis, epilepsy, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, podocytopathies, and stress.

"31305494","Zika circulation, congenital syndrome, and current guidelines: making sense of it all for the traveller.","Chen LH; Wilson ME","Current opinion in infectious diseases","2019","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Zika virus (ZIKV) swept through the Americas and led to recognition of its neurotropism. Zika circulation elsewhere in the world, nonvector transmission including maternal-fetal/sexual/transfusion routes, and additional reports on congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) have been published. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2018-2019, ZIKV transmission occurred in Cuba, India, and is suspected to appear sporadically in other countries. Maternal-fetal ZIKV transmission appears to occur in about 26% of ZIKV-infected pregnant women. The US ZIKV Pregnancy and Infant Registry identified 6% of live births to have at least one ZIKV-associated birth defect; 9% had at least one neurodevelopmental abnormality; 1% had both. Infectious virus was rarely isolated from semen of ZIKV-infected male patients beyond day 38 after symptom onset. Brazilian blood donations had low ZIKV prevalence in 2015-2016; in the United States, screening donations was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico. SUMMARY: ZIKV transmission continues; many countries with competent mosquitoes are at risk. Transmission can occur without detection where surveillance is poor and laboratory capacity limited. Travelers are important sentinels. Variations exist among ZIKV strains and Aedes mosquitoes that influence competence for transmission. Maternal-fetal transmission results in significant rates of abnormality. Identification of infectious virus in semen clarifies sexual transmission risk, with updated recommendations for preconception planning. ZIKV neurotropism requires further research and long-term follow-up.","10.1097/QCO.0000000000000575","Disease Transmission, Infectious; Global Health; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Prevalence; Topography, Medical; Travel-Related Illness; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Review"

They are often used for prolonged (weeks to months) periods of time, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies, or in those who have received a solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Long-term use of azoles is associated with hepatotoxicity and hormone-related effects, including gynecomastia, alopecia, decreased libido, oligospermia, azoospermia, impotence, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and (rarely) adrenal insufficiency. Voriconazole and posaconazole have been associated with peripheral neuropathies, and itraconazole and voriconazole with pancreatitis. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with periostitis, phototoxic reactions, and squamous cell carcinoma. Since many at-risk patients are commonly receiving multiple medications, it can be difficult for care providers to identify antifungal agent causality or contribution to patient symptoms.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible TCS were <55 years of age at diagnosis and treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Participants underwent physical examinations and completed questionnaires regarding 15 AHOs and health behaviors. Hypogonadism was defined as serum testosterone levels ≤3.0 ng/mL or use of testosterone replacement therapy. We investigated the role of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6258 and rs12150660) in the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) locus implicated in increased hypogonadism risk in the general population. RESULTS: Of 491 TCS (median age at assessment, 38.2 years; range, 18.7-68.4 years), 38.5% had hypogonadism. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis identified hypogonadism risk factors, including age at clinical evaluation (odds ratio [OR], 1.42 per 10-year increase; P= .006) and body mass index of 25 to <30 kg/m2 (OR, 2.08; P= .011) or ≥30 kg/m2 (OR, 2.36; P= .005) compared with <25 kg/m2. TCS with ≥2 risk alleles for the SHBG SNPs had a marginally significant increased hypogonadism risk (OR, 1.45; P= .09). Vigorous-intensity physical activity appeared protective (OR, 0.66; P= .07). Type of cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen and socioeconomic factors did not correlate with hypogonadism. Compared with TCS without hypogonadism, those with hypogonadism were more likely to report ≥2 AHOs (65% vs 51%; P= .003), to take medications for hypercholesterolemia (20.1% vs 6.0%; P<.001) or hypertension (18.5% vs 10.6%; P= .013), and to report erectile dysfunction (19.6% vs 11.9%; P= .018) or peripheral neuropathy (30.7% vs 22.5%; P= .041). A marginally significant trend for increased use of prescription medications for either diabetes (5.8% vs 2.6%; P= .07) or anxiety/depression (14.8% vs 9.3%; P= .06) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: At a relatively young median age, more than one-third of TCS have hypogonadism, which is significantly associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk factors, and erectile dysfunction.

Though Zika is typically asymptomatic or self-limiting, the sheer numbers of Zika infections led to the identification of unexpected phenotypes including sexual transmission, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and teratogenicity. Thousands of infants in South, Central, and North America have now been born with microcephaly or one of a number of fetal anomalies constituting the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Diagnosing CZS is based on a combination of clinical risk assessment and laboratory testing (which includes determining whether the mother has experienced a possible Zika infection during her pregnancy). A newborn suspected of having congenital Zika infection (due to maternal Zika infection or a birth defect described in association with congenital Zika infection) is then specifically tested for presence of Zika virus in neonatal tissue or anti-Zika IgM in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Though the guidelines are clear, there is room for considerable practice variation to emerge from individualized patient-provider encounters, largely due to limitations in diagnostic testing for Zika. The natural history of Zika further obscures our ability to know who, when, and how to test. Molecular diagnostics are highly specific but may not serve well those with asymptomatic infection. Serologic assays expand the diagnostic window but are complicated by cross-reactivity among related flaviviruses and passive immunity transferred from mother to baby. Furthermore, existing and emerging diagnostic tools may not be widely available due to limitations in resources and infrastructure of health systems in affected areas. Improvements in assay parameters as well as advances in platforms and deployability hold promise for optimizing diagnostic approaches for congenital Zika infection. The diagnostic tools and technologies under development must be integrated with forthcoming clinical knowledge of congenital Zika infection to fully realize the value that laboratory testing holds for diagnosing in utero mother to child transmission but also for understanding, predicting, and managing the health outcomes due to congenital Zika infection.","10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00003","Antibodies, Viral; Early Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pregnancy; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","TORCHZ; Zika virus; congenital infection; flavivirus; maternal child health; molecular diagnostics; serodiagnostics; vertical transmission","Journal Article; Review"

From the mid-1940s, the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to -4) have caused 15 epidemics of variable severity. In 2013, for the first time, a sustained co-circulation of two different DENV serotypes (DENV-1 and -3) was reported. The same year, Zika virus (ZIKV) caused the largest outbreak ever recorded at that time. Severe neurologic complications in adults, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and central nervous system malformations in newborns and foeteuses, such as microcephaly, were reported, and a causal link with ZIKV infection was established. In addition to mosquito-borne transmission, the potential for perinatal, sexual and blood-transfusion transmission of ZIKV was demonstrated. In 2014, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused an explosive outbreak. Series of Guillain-Barré syndrome temporally associated with the CHIKV epidemic were reported. Except for DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV, no other arboviruses have been detected so far, but serologic evidence suggested the past silent circulation of Ross River virus. From May 2015 DENV-1 has been the only arbovirus transmitted in French Polynesia, but the reemergence of DENV-2 is highly expected since the detection of two autochthonous cases of DENV-2 infection in June 2018.","10.1016/j.nmni.2019.01.009","","Arbovirus; French Polynesia; Pacific; Ross River; Zika; chikungunya; dengue","Journal Article; Review"

Since then the virus has spread across Latin America, Caribbean, and North America. It seems clear that Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus are the main vectors of the pathogen. ZIKV infection symptoms are similar to other flaviviruses such as a dengue infection and therefore can be easily confounded. Currently, the ZIKV maintains two life cycles. The first, and the original one is the sylvatic/enzootic cycle that occurs in Africa. The second life cycle is the suburban-urban transmission cycle that emerged through natural evolution. ZIKV has gained the ability to maintain this human-endemic cycle in urban and suburban areas. ZIKV has never been isolated from non primates, so it is not clear whether other species can act as reservoir hosts. Several reports have been made of non-vector ZIKV transmission including breast-milk feeding, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse, saliva, urine, and physical contact (sweat, tears). A major global concern with ZIKV infection is the reported increase in cases of microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) in the Americas after the recent ZIKV outbreak. Currently, there is no available vaccine for ZIKV. Therefore, prevention of ZIKV infection must be emphasized by local public health authorities promoting collective responsibility and engagement for integrated vector management through environmental management, biological control, and as a last resource chemical control.",NA,"Aedes; Americas; Animals; Brazil; Environmental Health; Humans; Phylogeny; Public Health; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes aegypti; Americas; ZIKV","Journal Article"

Zika virus disease entered the Caribbean in 2013 with increased reporting of cases across the region in 2016, affecting more than 50 countries. This study aimed to ascertain the knowledge of, attitudes and practices towards Zika virus disease among antenatal clinic attenders in Trinidad and Tobago during the 2016 outbreak. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was undertaken. METHODS: A knowledge attitudes and practices survey was conducted among antenatal clinic attenders at publicly funded primary care health centres. All counties of Trinidad (except St Patrick, Caroni and Victoria) and Tobago were included in the study. Within each county, three health centres were selected at random. At the antenatal clinic of each selected health centre, antenatal clients were selected by randomly selecting their patient file from that day's antenatal clinic patient files. Data collection occurred from September to November 2016. The knowledge, attitudes and practice survey was administered by an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The World Health Organization Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice surveys Zika virus disease and potential complications Resource pack was adapted for use as the data collection tool. All data collected were analysed using SPSS software, version 23. Tests with P-values less than 0.05 were deemed significant. RESULTS: Seventy-four percent (74%) of responders did not think there was a link between sexual transmission and Zika. About 19% stated that abstaining could prevent Zika but only 6.6% actually practiced this. Seventy-six percent knew the risk of microcephaly, and this knowledge of the risk of microcephaly was found to be significantly associated with the number of weeks' gestation. Less than 40% knew the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Doctors at health centres followed by private doctors were the top two trusted information sources for responders. Responders thought that the government could spray insecticide, clean drains, educate community members and clean overgrown vacant lots of land. CONCLUSION: The government and healthcare workers need to reach specific target groups with accurate messages to minimize the associated morbidity and thereby safeguarding national and global health security.","10.1016/j.puhe.2018.09.025","Adolescent; Adult; Caribbean Region; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Pregnant People; Prenatal Care; Public Health Practice; Risk; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Zika Virus Infection","Attitudes; Global health; Knowledge; Practices; Pregnancy; Zika","Journal Article"

Practitioners knowledgeable about the evidence base behind common integrative approaches can help patients attain improved quality of life, and at times, improved survival. Evidence-based recommendations include the following: a plant-based diet for general health after diagnosis, and carbohydrate restriction for patients with estrogen receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer may be prudent. Other dietary recommendations include a 13-h daily overnight fast. Carefully selected patients may choose to fast the day before and the day of chemotherapy to decrease side effects. Specific food recommendations include avoidance or limitation of alcohol, and liberal culinary use of cruciferous vegetables, coffee, green tea, soy, and flaxseed. Promising supplements include diindolylmethane and melatonin. Omega 3 fatty acids may help with bone density in patients on aromatase inhibitors, but may increase chemotherapy resistance. Findings regarding the usefulness of multivitamins, vitamin D, vitamin C, and vitamin E are weak and/or mixed different exercise modalities may have different effects and thus play different roles in breast cancer therapy. Aerobic and resistance training combined during breast cancer chemotherapy may confer a survival benefit, while yoga may improve outcome in lymphedema patients. Current evidence suggests that meditation, yoga, breathing, music therapy, guided imagery, and hypnosis may improve mood and quality of life during breast cancer treatment.

Vaginal moisturizers and vaginal rings supplying low-dose estrogen can be useful in the treatment of symptoms of estrogen-deprivation states caused by breast cancer treatments; such symptoms include vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and sexual dysfunction. Carbon dioxide laser technology can rejuvenate atrophied vaginal mucosa and relieve dyspareunia, allowing avoidance of estrogen therapy.

ZIKV infection has been known to be rather asymptomatic or presented as febrile self-limited disease; however, during the last decade the manifestation of ZIKV infection has been associated with a variety of neuroimmunological disorders including Guillain⁻Barré syndrome, microcephaly and other central nervous system abnormalities. More recently, there is accumulating evidence about sexual transmission of ZIKV, a trait that has never been observed in any other mosquito-borne flavivirus before.

ZIKV infection has devastating consequences, such as neurological congenital malformations in infants born to infected mothers and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Additionally, its potential for transmission through vector bites, as well as from person to person through blood transfusions and sexual contact, are important considerations for prompt diagnosis. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal method, was developed as an alternative field-applicable assay to PCR. Here we report the development of a novel ZIKV real-time reverse transcriptase RPA (RT-RPA) assay capable of detecting a range of different ZIKV strains from a variety of geographical locations. The ZIKV RT-RPA was shown to be highly sensitive, being capable of detecting as few as five copies of target nucleic acid per reaction, and suitable for use with a battery-operated portable device. The ZIKV RT-RPA demonstrated 100 % specificity and 83 % sensitivity in clinical samples. Furthermore, we determined that the ZIKV RT-RPA is a versatile assay that can be applied to crude samples, such as saliva and serum, and can be used as a vector surveillance tool on crude mosquito homogenates. Therefore, the developed ZIKV RT-RPA is a useful diagnostic tool that can be transferred to a resource-limited location, eliminating the need for a specialized and sophisticated laboratory environment and highly trained staff.","10.1099/jgv.0.001083","Animals; Conserved Sequence; Culicidae; Genetic Variation; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Point-of-Care Systems; RNA, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Zika Virus","RPA; Zika; field-diagnostic; isothermal; molecular detection; point-of-care; recombinase polymerase amplification","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Therefore, we substantiated the scarce knowledge regarding long-term QoL after breast cancer, burdensome problems, and unmet needs for more support. METHODS: Disease-free breast cancer survivors (n = 190) who had participated in two randomized controlled exercise trials during primary treatment were followed up to 5 years post-diagnosis. QoL-related functions and symptoms (EORTC QLQ-C30/-BR23), health problems, and support needs were assessed. EORTC-QLQ scores were compared with age-matched normative values from the general population in Germany. RESULTS: QoL-related functions and symptoms in patients during cancer treatment were worse compared to healthy references, but largely improved over time. Yet, cognitive function and sleep were still significantly impaired at 5-year follow-up. Other common long-term problems included sexual issues (45% of survivors), hot flashes (38%), pain (34%), fatigue (24%), and polyneuropathy (21%). Regression analyses indicated fatigue having the strongest impact on global QoL. Support needs were expressed mainly for menopausal disorders (43%), physical performance (39%), sleep problems (38%), arthralgia (37%), cognitive problems (36%), weight problems (32%), and fatigue (31%). CONCLUSIONS: While QoL in disease-free breast cancer survivors 5 years post-diagnosis was largely comparable to the general population on average, still many survivors suffered from adverse effects. There appears to be a need for ongoing screening and support regarding fatigue, sleep problems, cognitive problems, arthralgia/pain, menopausal/sexual symptoms, physical performance, and weight problems during and several years following breast cancer therapy.","10.1007/s11136-018-1866-8","Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires","Breast cancer survivors; Cognitive function; Fatigue; Long-term quality of life; Menopausal symptoms; Sleep problems","Journal Article"

We carried out a total of six regular check-ups between 2006 and 2014, and from 2008 we added neurological evaluations including neuropsychological test and autonomic nervous function test in parallel with medical follow-up as much as was possible. Severe autonomic failure, such as hyperhidrosis, pollakiuria, diarrhoea, diminished libido, and asthenia appeared in almost all victims. Polyneuropathy occurred in 35% of the victims and constricted vision occurred in 20% of them. The rates of abnormal response on cold pressor test (CPT), active standing test (AST), Heart rate variability (CVR-R), performed in 2014, were 63.1%, 31.6%, and 15.9%, respectively. On neuropsychological testing evaluated in 2010, a generalized cognitive decline was observed in 42% of the victims. Memories and visuospatial abilities were affected in the remaining victims. Finally, a 17-item PTSD questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory evaluated in 2014 revealed long-lasting severe PTSD symptoms and depression of the victims.

Other ways of transmission include the perinatal and sexual routes, blood transfusion, and laboratory exposure. Although the first human cases were registered in 1952 in African countries, outbreaks were only reported since 2007, when entire Pacific islands were affected. In March 2015, the first cases of ZIKV acute infection were notified in Brazil and, to date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed local mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV. Until 2015, ZIKV infection was thought to only cause asymptomatic or mild exanthematous febrile infections. However, after explosive ZIKV outbreaks in Polynesia and Latin American countries, it was confirmed that ZIKV could also lead to Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital birth abnormalities. These abnormalities, which can include neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and skeletal findings, are now considered congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Brain abnormalities in CZS include cerebral calcifications, malformations of cortical development, ventriculomegaly, lissencephaly, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and brainstem. The ocular findings, which are present in up to 70% of infants with CZS, include iris coloboma, lens subluxation, cataract, congenital glaucoma, and especially posterior segment findings. Loss of retinal pigment epithelium, the presence of a thin choroid, a perivascular choroidal inflammatory infiltrate, and atrophic changes within the optic nerve were seen in histologic analyses of eyes from deceased fetuses. To date, there is no ZIKV licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies are available for treatment. Preventive measures include individual protection from mosquito bites, control of mosquito populations and the use of barriers measures such as condoms during sexual intercourse or sexual abstinence for couples either at risk or after confirmed infection. A literature review based on studies that analyzed ocular findings in mothers and infants with CZS, with or without microcephaly, was conducted and a theoretical pathophysiologic explanation for ZIKV-ocular abnormalities was formulated.","10.1016/j.preteyeres.2018.04.004","Eye Infections, Viral; Female; Humans; Microcephaly; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Review"

Zika virus infections also have been documented through intrauterine transmission resulting in congenital infection; intrapartum transmission from a viremic mother to her newborn; sexual transmission; blood transfusion; and laboratory exposure (1-3). Most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic or result in mild clinical illness, characterized by acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or nonpurulent conjunctivitis; Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and severe thrombocytopenia rarely have been associated with Zika virus infection (1). However, congenital Zika virus infection can result in fetal loss, microcephaly, and other birth defects (1,2). In 2016, a total of 5,168 noncongenital Zika virus disease cases were reported from U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Most cases (4,897, 95%) were in travelers returning from Zika virus-affected areas. A total of 224 (4%) cases were acquired through presumed local mosquitoborne transmission, and 47 (1%) were acquired by other routes. It is important that providers in the United States continue to test symptomatic patients who live in or recently traveled to areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission or had unprotected sex with someone who lives in or traveled to those areas.

In adults, infection may trigger autoimmune inflammatory polyneuropathy. Transmission most commonly follows the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes but may also occur through sexual intercourse or receipt of blood products. Definitive diagnosis through detection of viral RNA is possible in serum or plasma within 10 days of disease onset, in whole blood within 3 weeks of onset, and in semen for up to 3 months. Serological diagnosis is nonetheless critical because few patients have access to molecular diagnostics during the acute phase of infection and infection may be associated with only mild or inapparent disease that does not prompt molecular testing. Serological diagnosis is confounded by cross-reactivity of immune sera with other flaviviruses endemic in the areas where ZIKV has recently emerged. Accordingly, we built a high-density microarray comprising nonredundant 12-mer peptides that tile, with one-residue overlap, the proteomes of Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Ilheus, Oropouche, and chikungunya viruses. Serological analysis enabled discovery of a ZIKV NS2B 20-residue peptide that had high sensitivity (96.0%) and specificity (95.9%) versus natural infection with or vaccination against dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, or Japanese encephalitis virus in a microarray assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of early-convalescent-phase sera (2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptomatic infection).IMPORTANCE The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a teratogen is a profound challenge to global public health. Molecular diagnosis of infection is straightforward during the 3-week period when patients are viremic. However, serological diagnosis thereafter of historical exposure has been confounded by cross-reactivity. Using high-density peptide arrays that tile the proteomes of a selection of flaviviruses to identify a ZIKV-specific peptide, we established two assays that enable sensitive and specific diagnosis of exposure to ZIKV. These assays may be useful in guiding clinical management of mothers at risk for potential exposure to ZIKV and enable insights into the epidemiology of ZIKV infections.","10.1128/mBio.00095-18","Arboviruses; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Flavivirus; RNA, Viral; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Zika; arbovirus; emerging infectious diseases; flavivirus; serology","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Alike other flaviviruses, the principal mode of ZIKV transmission is by mosquitoes. Advances in research have provided reliable diagnostics for detecting ZIKV infection, while several drug/therapeutic targets and vaccine candidates have been identified recently. Despite these progresses, currently there is neither any effective drug nor any vaccine available against ZIKV. Under such circumstances and to tackle the problem at large, control measures of which mosquito population control need to be strengthened following appropriate mechanical, chemical, biological and genetic control measures. Apart from this, several other known modes of ZIKV transmission which have gained importance in recent past such as intrauterine, sexual intercourse, and blood-borne spread need to be checked and kept under control by adopting appropriate precautions and utmost care during sexual intercourse, blood transfusion and organ transplantation. The virus inactivation by pasteurization, detergents, chemicals, and filtration can effectively reduce viral load in plasma-derived medicinal products. Added to this, strengthening of the surveillance and monitoring of ZIKV as well as avoiding travel to Zika infected areas would aid in keeping viral infection under check. Here, we discuss the salient advances in the prevention and control strategies to combat ZIKV with a focus on highlighting various intervention approaches against the vector mosquitoes of this viral pathogen along with presenting an overview regarding human intervention measures to counter other modes of ZIKV transmission and spread.

Several key findings have been highlighted in our review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were consulted to find published studies, from 1980 to May 2017, that met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The majority of studies investigated older adult TCSs, while few studies on adolescent and young adult patients were available. Many studies indicate that health-related QoL (HRQoL) is similar among the TCSs and the general population. Even if QoL deteriorates so clear at the time of diagnosis and throughout treatment, afterward returns to normal levels, as defined by the matched controls. However, there are numerous chronic conditions consequent to diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer that plague survivors and affect QoL, like Raynaud-like phenomena, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, anxiety, sexual, fertility and body image problems. Even if these problems can have no effects on the measures of global QoL, they have an impact on the quality of life. Differences between TCSs with and without a partner bring to different outcomes in the adjustments to cancer. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to identify TCSs with higher risks of poorer QoL outcomes, to focus interventions on the areas with the greatest impairments. Further researches should consider the effects of testicular cancer on the impaired areas, collecting more data to better identify survivor's needs and consequent interventions, with a special focus on adolescent and young adult TCSs.

In most cases, it remained detected in blood from few days to 1 week after the onset of symptoms, and can persist longer in urine and in semen. ZIKV infection can have dramatic consequences such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. ZIKV sexual transmission has been documented. A better understanding of ZIKV presence and persistence across biologic compartments is needed to devise rational measures to prevent its transmission. METHODS: This observational cohort study will recruit non-pregnant participants aged 18 years and above with confirmed ZIKV infection [positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in blood and/or urine]: symptomatic men and women in ZIKV infection acute phase, and their symptomatic or asymptomatic household/sexual infected contacts. Specimens of blood, urine, semen, vaginal secretion/menstrual blood, rectal swab, oral fluids, tears, sweat, urine and breast milk (if applicable) will be collected at pre-established intervals and tested for ZIKV RNA presence by RT-PCR, other co-infection (dengue, Chikungunya, HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis), antibody response (including immunoglobulins M and G), plaque reduction neutralization test (if simultaneously positive for ZIKV and dengue), and ZIKV culture and RNA sequencing. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and comorbidities will be collected in parallel. Participants will be followed up for 12 months. DISCUSSION: This prolonged longitudinal follow-up of ZIKV infected persons with regular biologic testing and data collection will offer a unique opportunity to investigate the presence and persistence of ZIKV in various biologic compartments, their clinical and immunological correlates as well as the possibility of ZIKV reactivation/reinfection over time. This valuable information will substantially contribute to the body of knowledge on ZIKV infection and serve as a base for the development of more effective recommendation on the prevention of ZIKV transmission.

Zika rapidly spread across Brazil and to more than 50 other countries and territories on the American continent. The Aedesaegypti mosquito is thought to be the principal vector responsible for the widespread transmission of the virus. However, sexual transmission has also been reported. The explosively emerging epidemic has had diverse impacts on population health, coinciding with cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome and an unexpected epidemic of newborns with microcephaly and other neurological impairments. This led to Brazil declaring a national public health emergency in November 2015, followed by a similar decision by the World Health Organization three months later. While dengue virus serotypes took several decades to spread across Brazil, the Zika virus epidemic diffused within months, extending beyond the area of permanent dengue transmission, which is bound by a climatic barrier in the south and low population density areas in the north. This rapid spread was probably due to a combination of factors, including a massive susceptible population, climatic conditions conducive for the mosquito vector, alternative non-vector transmission, and a highly mobile population. The epidemic has since subsided, but many unanswered questions remain. In this article, we provide an overview of the discovery of Zika virus in Brazil, including its emergence and spread, epidemiological surveillance, vector and non-vector transmission routes, clinical complications, and socio-economic impacts. We discuss gaps in the knowledge and the challenges ahead to anticipate, prevent, and control emerging and re-emerging epidemics of arboviruses in Brazil and worldwide.","10.3390/ijerph15010096","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Brazil; Child; Child, Preschool; Epidemics; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Public Health; Young Adult; Zika Virus Infection","Congenital Zika Syndrome; Zika virus; epidemiology; microcephaly; socio-economic impact; surveillance; vector control","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

A survey was administered in NYC adapted from the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey on Zika virus developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). METHODS: A standardized, self-administered, anonymous questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample in Manhattan and the Bronx from June 30th, 2016 to October 21st, 2016. Responses were grouped into six domains based on the content and structure of the questions and were summarized using descriptive statistics or converted into a continuous knowledge score and assessed for associations with pregnancy status and travel history using linear regression. RESULTS: There were 224 respondents with a mean age of 33 (SD ± 11.6) with 77% (170/224) female and 24% (51/224) pregnant. The majority (98% (213/217)) were unable to identify all of the symptoms associated with acute Zika virus infection and all modes of transmission (97% (213/219)). Most participants (85% (187/219)) identified mosquitoes as a mode of transmission. 95% (116/122) reported an association between Zika virus and microcephaly. The most concerning aspect of Zika virus in 46% (91/200) was the risk of disabilities to babies, and risk of sexual transmission (25% (49/200)). When asked what precautions pregnant persons should to reduce the risk of transmission when traveling to a Zika endemic region, only 27% (50/185) identified using condoms during intercourse or refraining from intercourse while pregnant. Knowledge of Zika transmission is significantly positively associated with pregnancy status, but not with travel history. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate an overall poor understanding of Zika virus symptoms and possible complications, transmission modes, and current recommended prevention guidelines. Pregnancy is positively associated with Knowledge of Zika Transmission, but not other knowledge scores. Reported travel history to Zika endemic regions is not significantly associated with Zika knowledge. There is a need for implementing future public health interventions that particularly focus on protection against Zika transmission, that Zika is sexually transmitted, and risks that the Guillain-Barré Syndrome poses a risk to adults.","10.1186/s12889-017-4991-3","Adult; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; New York City; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Pregnant People; Surveys and Questionnaires; Travel; Travel-Related Illness; Zika Virus Infection","Health promotion; Maternal health; Zika virus","Journal Article"

Here, we discuss the findings from these models regarding the role that the innate and adaptive immune responses have in controlling ZIKV infection and pathogenesis. Additionally, we examine how innate and adaptive immune responses influence sexual and vertical transmission of ZIKV infection as well as how these responses can influence the ability of ZIKV to cross the placenta and to induce damage in the developing brain.","10.1111/imm.12883","Animals; Central Nervous System; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Immunocompromised Host; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Inflammation; Pregnancy; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","T cell; innate receptors; neuroinflammation; reproductive Immunology; viral","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural; Review"

DESIGN AND SETTING: Guidelines were collected via experts and via literature database, guideline database and cancer agency websites searches. METHOD: EB guidelines in any language published between 2012 and 2017 were collected. EB recommendations on survivorship care relevant for PCPs were extracted and grouped into three categories (recurrence detection, long-term effects and recurrence prevention). The content of the recommendations was analysed and summarised in the number and type of clinical topics addressed. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the guidelines. RESULTS: Six guidelines, of which two were of acceptable methodological quality, were included. One was specifically made for general practitioners. Fifteen clinical topics were identified. Guidelines differed in the clinical topics addressed and for some identical topics in the content of the recommendations. Many recommendations were based on low-quality evidence. Recurrence detection received most attention, physical examination and mammography were often highlighted. Potential complications largely varied in number and type. Intimacy concerns, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, fatigue, menopausal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy and lymphedema were reported in more than one guideline. Recurrence prevention was mentioned in four guidelines; all recommended physical activity. CONCLUSION: The number of EB recommendations in guidelines is limited. Moreover, recommendations differ between guidelines and most are based on low-quality evidence. More high-quality research is needed to develop and adapt guidelines to support PCPs in providing optimal breast cancer survivorship care.","10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015118","Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; General Practitioners; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Primary Health Care","breast tumours; primary care","Journal Article; Review"

His medical background was unremarkable except for cigarette smoking and hyperlipidemia. Sjögren's syndrome was ruled out, and he was referred for evaluation of orthostatic hypotension, which by then included syncopal episodes and injuries. Additional symptoms included dry eyes, constipation, reduced sweating, and erectile dysfunction. After excluding medications and structural cardiac abnormalities as causes of orthostatic hypotension, a clinical autonomic evaluation was performed. The pattern of beat-to-beat blood pressure associated with performance of the Valsalva maneuver, and a low plasma norepinephrine level that did not increase in response to standing, established that the orthostatic hypotension was neurogenic. Treatment with an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist and fludrocortisone yielded partial improvement. After systemic diseases involving autonomic failure were excluded, cardiac sympathetic neuroimaging was performed by 123I-metaliodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning. The normal uptake seen in the heart indicated intact post ganglionic sympathetic innervation. There were no signs of central neurodegeneration or peripheral neuropathy. Because of symptoms and signs of both parasympathetic and sympathetic failure without denervation, an autonomic ganglionopathy was considered. A high titer of antibody to the neuronal nicotinic receptor, which mediates ganglionic neurotransmission, was obtained. The diagnosis of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) was made, and the management strategy shifted to first lowering the antibody burden by plasma exchanges and then instituting chronic anti-autoimmune treatment with rituximab and a low dose of cortiosteroid.

Here we present the ZikaPLAN (Zika Preparedness Latin American Network) consortium. ZikaPLAN combines the strengths of 25 partners in Latin America, North America, Africa, Asia, and various centers in Europe. We will conduct clinical studies to estimate the risk and further define the full spectrum and risk factors of congenital Zika virus syndrome (including neurodevelopmental milestones in the first 3 years of life), delineate neurological complications associated with ZIKV due to direct neuroinvasion and immune-mediated responses in older children and adults, and strengthen surveillance for birth defects and Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Laboratory-based research to unravel neurotropism and investigate the role of sexual transmission, determinants of severe disease, and viral fitness will underpin the clinical studies. Social messaging and engagement with affected communities, as well as development of wearable repellent technologies against Aedes mosquitoes will enhance the impact. Burden of disease studies, data-driven vector control, and vaccine modeling as well as risk assessments on geographic spread of ZIKV will form the foundation for evidence-informed policies. While addressing the research gaps around ZIKV, we will engage in capacity building in laboratory and clinical research, collaborate with existing and new networks to share knowledge, and work with international organizations to tackle regulatory and other bottlenecks and refine research priorities. In this way, we can leverage the ZIKV response toward building a long-term emerging infectious diseases response capacity in the region to address future challenges.","10.1080/16549716.2017.1398485","Aedes; Animals; Biomedical Research; Capacity Building; Child; Cooperative Behavior; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Interinstitutional Relations; Latin America; Mosquito Control; Mosquito Vectors; Public Health Surveillance; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Zika Virus Infection","European Commission; Zika; collaboration; congenital Zika syndrome; epidemic preparedness; public health emergency; research capacity building network","Journal Article"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: Patients recruited into a nationwide cohort and assessed for prevalence and type of concomitant medication (including polypharmacy, defined as ≥5 concomitant medications), pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions, potential concomitant medication adverse effects and concomitant medication adherence. Factors associated with concomitant medication polypharmacy and with imperfect adherence were identified using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 522 participants, 392 (75%) took a concomitant medication (mostly cardiovascular, nonprescription or antidepressant). Overall, 280 participants (54%) had polypharmacy of concomitant medications and/or a drug interaction or contraindication. Polypharmacy was present in 122 (23%) and independently associated with clinical trial participation, renal impairment, major comorbidity, hospital/general practice-based HIV care (versus sexual health clinic) and benzodiazepine use. Seventeen participants (3%) took at least one concomitant medication contraindicated with their antiretroviral therapy, and 237 (45%) had at least one pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction. Concomitant medication use was significantly associated with sleep disturbance and myalgia, and polypharmacy of concomitant medications with diarrhoea, fatigue, myalgia and peripheral neuropathy. Sixty participants (12%) reported imperfect concomitant medication adherence, independently associated with requiring financial support, foregoing necessities for financial reasons, good/very good self-reported general health and at least 1 bed day for illness in the previous 12 months.

We investigated the symptom clusters and effects of symptom clusters on the quality of life of patients with ovarian cancer. METHOD: We recruited 210 ovarian cancer patients being treated with chemotherapy and used a descriptive cross-sectional study design to collect information on their symptoms. To determine inter-relationships among symptoms, a principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed based on the patient's symptoms (fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction). RESULTS: All patients had experienced at least two domains of concurrent symptoms, and there were two types of symptom clusters. The first symptom cluster consisted of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance symptoms, while the second symptom cluster consisted of pain and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy symptoms. Our subgroup cluster analysis showed that ovarian cancer patients with higher-scoring symptoms had significantly poorer quality of life in both symptom cluster 1 and 2 subgroups, with subgroup-specific patterns. The symptom clusters were different depending on age, age at disease onset, disease duration, recurrence, and performance status of patients with ovarian cancer. In addition, ovarian cancer patients experienced different symptom clusters according to cancer stage. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated that there is a specific pattern of symptom clusters, and symptom clusters negatively influence the quality of life in patients with ovarian cancer. Identifying symptom clusters of ovarian cancer patients may have clinical implications in improving symptom management.","10.1016/j.ejon.2017.07.007","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Ovarian Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Syndrome","Chemotherapy; Ovarian cancer; Quality of life; Symptom clusters","Journal Article"

While sexual transmission and presence of ZIKV in urine, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva have been established, the origin of persistent virus shedding into biological secretions is not clear. Using a primary adult murine neuronal culture model, we have determined that ZIKV persistently and productively infects sensory neurons of the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia, which innervate glands and mucosa of the face and the genitourinary tract, respectively, without apparent injury. Autonomic neurons that innervate these regions are not permissive for infection. However, productive ZIKV infection of satellite glial cells that surround and support sensory and autonomic neurons in peripheral ganglia results in their destruction. Persistent infection of sensory neurons, without affecting their viability, provides a potential reservoir for viral shedding in biological secretions for extended periods of time after infection. Furthermore, viral destruction of satellite glial cells may contribute to the development of Guillain-Barré Syndrome via an alternative mechanism to the established autoimmune response.","10.3390/pathogens6040049","","Guillain-Barré; Zika virus; autonomic; neurons; satellite glial cells; sensory","Journal Article"

Daily low dose (5 mg) of tadalafil has also been used for the treatment of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). PDE5 inhibitors induce relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the urethra, prostate, bladder neck, and blood vessels. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of tadalafil on vessels endothelial function, in patients with male LUTS symptoms associated with BPH. METHODS: The Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this clinical study and informed consents had been obtained from 81 BPH patients. The following male LUTS parameters: international prostate symptom score (IPSS), overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), voiding volume, max and mean voiding flow on voiding flowmetry examination and post-voiding residual urine (RU) were compared at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after a daily dose of 5 mg tadalafil. In addition, erectile function was evaluated by the sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) score and vessels endothelial function and peripheral neuropathy were assessed by the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), ankle brachial index (ABI), and vibration perception threshold (VPT) at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of 81 patients was 66.4 ± 11.4 years old. Their prostate size was 30.2 ± 22.1 ml. Male LUTS parameters including IPSS, OABSS, and RU showed significant improvement from 1 to 12 months after tadalafil administration. Max and mean voiding flow was significantly increased at 6 months after tadalafil treatment. The SHIM score showed significant improvement after 3 months. Whilst, the results of baPWV also showed significant improvement from 3 to 12 months. ABI was also significantly improved at 6 months. However, there was no change in the VPT at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: Tadalafil is effective for both male LUTS and ED. It is also shown that tadalafil improves baPWV, which we can conclude that higher vessels elasticity has been obtained. This major finding of this study shows that tadalafil has the potency to improve vessels endothelial dysfunction in patients with BPH.","10.1080/13685538.2017.1367922","Aged; Ankle Brachial Index; Endothelium, Vascular; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms; Male; Middle Aged; Penile Erection; Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors; Prospective Studies; Prostate; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Pulse Wave Analysis; Tadalafil","Tadalafil; endothelial function; erectile dysfunction; male lower urinary tract symptoms","Journal Article"

CR has been established as a non-genetic method of altering longevity and attenuating biological changes associated with aging. Aging is also an important risk factor for erectile dysfunction. The aim of this study was to examine whether CR diet can reverse the age-related alterations of erectile tissue in the aged rat. Four groups of rats were used: young rats (7 months) + ad libitum, aged rats (22 months) + ad libitum, young rats + CR diet, and aged rats + CR diet. The ad libitum group had free access to both food and water, and CR groups were fed 60% of the food intake of their ad libitum littermates, starting from 6 weeks before sacrifice. The penis was harvested and stained with antibodies to von Willebrand factor, smooth muscle α-actin, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, phospho-eNOS, nNOS, and neurofilament. We also performed Masson trichrome staining and TUNEL assay. The blood samples were collected for the measurement of serum total testosterone level. The contents of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and neuronal cells as well as serum testosterone levels were significantly lower in the penis of aged rats than in their young littermates. CR significantly restored cavernous endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and neuronal cell contents and decreased cavernous endothelial cell apoptosis and fibrosis in both young and aged rats. CR also increased serum testosterone level in aged rats, but not in young rats. CR successfully improved age-related derangements in penile neurovascular structures and hormonal disturbance. Along with a variety of lifestyle modifications, our study gave us a scientific rationale for CR as a non-pharmaceutical strategy to reprogram damaged erectile tissue toward neurovascular repair in aged men.","10.1111/andr.12401","Aging; Animals; Apoptosis; Caloric Restriction; Endothelium, Vascular; Erectile Dysfunction; Fibrosis; Male; Nerve Regeneration; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Penis; Phosphorylation; Rats; Testosterone","ageing/aging; angiopathy; calorie restriction; erectile dysfunction; peripheral neuropathy","Journal Article"

METHODS: Between June 6 and June 19, 2016 we conducted an online survey of doctors working in obstetrics and gynaecology, neonatology and paediatrics in Singapore. The survey included 15 multiple choice questions to measure respondents' knowledge of Zika virus in four domains covering clinical and public health. RESULTS: A total of 110 survey responses (15% response rate) were obtained, 82% of respondents worked in the public sector. Overall, the median respondent score was 9.4 (Max score=15), with substantial variation (range: 3.5 - 14.7). Microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome were recognised as causal complications of Zika virus infection by 99% and 50% of respondents respectively.  Clinical features which could help differentiate Zika from Dengue were less well understood with 50% and 68% correctly identifying conjunctivitis and low grade fever respectively. Worryingly, 14% favoured non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as part of treatment, without first excluding dengue as a diagnosis. Also, only 36% of respondents were aware of the current recommendation for preventing sexual transmission of Zika virus. Fewer than 50% were aware of the need for ophthalmological evaluation as part of congenital Zika virus infection. DISCUSSION: Our assessment demonstrates that there is good awareness of the clinical manifestation of Zika virus disease among key specialty doctors, but confusion with Dengue disease remains. It also highlights knowledge gaps in the prevention of sexually-transmitted Zika virus infection and the clinical management of congenital Zika virus infection in newborns. Our study identified strategic areas to improve communication to front-line doctors during public health response to the Zika epidemic.","10.1371/currents.outbreaks.44b19196298e01f3a6dcd4c09f235fa8","","","Journal Article"

Infection can cause microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that ZIKV is sexually transmitted, especially from infected males to uninfected females. This study aimed to investigate the transmission pattern of ZIKV in semen using boar semen. Experiments were performed ex vivo using semen from healthy boar. The samples were infected with ZIKV, and viral RNA was detected and cell morphology was examined at different time points postinfection. ZIKV infection was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Viral RNA levels were found to markedly decrease as the time postinfection increased, without any evidence of virus replication. The sperm showed no significant changes in morphology. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of virus-free sperm, suggesting that ZIKV cannot replicate in boar semen. We suggest three possible reasons underlying this phenomenon. First, the spermatozoa of boar might not be the target of ZIKV associated with sexual transmission. Second, the effect of the external environment on spermatozoa may affect ZIKV replication. Third, ZIKV may not be tropic for spermatozoa. This ex vivo study might be used as a platform to study the association of sexual transmission with ZIKV in other longer-lasting cells, such as Leydig or Sertoli cells.","10.1007/s00705-017-3453-7","Animals; Male; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Semen; Spermatozoa; Swine; Zika Virus","","Journal Article"

METHODS: A convenience sample of 39,088 SCPs completed for cancer survivors with an Internet-based SCP tool was examined; it included 5847 CC survivors (15%; CC was defined as chronic leukemia and/or recurrent/metastatic cancer of another nature). Patient-reported treatment effects and follow-up care patterns were compared between CC survivors and survivors treated with curative intent (CI). Responses from a follow-up survey regarding SCP satisfaction and use were reviewed. RESULTS: CC survivors had greater odds of experiencing multiple treatment-related effects than survivors treated with CI; these effects included fatigue, cognitive changes, dyspnea, peripheral neuropathy, lymphedema, and erectile dysfunction. Nearly half of CC survivors were managed by an oncologist alone, and they were less likely than CI patients to be comanaged by a primary care provider and an oncologist. Fewer SCPs were generated by health care providers (HCPs) for CC survivors versus CI survivors. A smaller proportion of CC users versus CI users rated their experience and satisfaction with the SCP tool as very good or excellent, and CC users were less likely to share the HCP summary with their health care team. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of CC survivors, often considered incurable but treatable, seek survivorship support. Tools to facilitate participation, communication, and coordination of care are valuable for these patients, and future iterations of SCPs should be designed to address the particular circumstances of living with CC.

"28638259","Global Alert: Zika Virus-an Emerging Arbovirus.","Ozkurt Z; Tanriverdi EC","The Eurasian journal of medicine","2017","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus of the Flavivirus genus, and it has an envelope and a single RNA molecule. In early 2016, the World Health Organization declared ZIKV infection to be an emerging global health threat. The major transmission route of the virus to humans is Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV can be transmitted between humans by transplacental, perinatal, and sexual routes and via blood and body fluids. ZIKV infection usually results in a mild and self-limiting disease with low-grade fever, conjunctivitis, and periorbital edema. Neurological complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute myelitis, and transverse myelitis have been reported during ZIKV infection. Intrauterine and congenital ZIKV infections have strong teratogenic effects on the fetus. Intrauterine or congenital ZIKV infection can lead to microcephaly, ocular anomalies (such as macular atrophy, pigment mottling, and optic nerve anomalies), and cardiac anomalies (such as atrial or ventricular septal defect). Calcification in the brain between the cortical and subcortical areas, ventriculomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum hypoplasia, cortical/subcortical atrophy, delayed myelination, enlarged cisterna magna, and craniofacial disproportion have been reported as brain development defects. ZIKV infection usually results in a mild disease, and it does not require specific therapy. However, complications of infection during the early period of life are serious. Thus, many drugs have been investigated, and vaccine development studies have been conducted to prevent ZIKV infection. Vector control and personal protection from mosquito-borne transmission are important for decreasing the prevalence of ZIKV infection. In particular, pregnant residents or travelers to endemic areas should be carefully protected against mosquito-borne transmission. Zika virus (ZIKV), Flavivirus ailesinden sivrisineklerle bulaşan zarflı ve tek sarmallı RNA’ya sahip bir arbovirusdur. 2016 yılı başında Dünya Sağlık Örgütü (DSÖ) ZIKV enfeksiyonunun giderek önemi artan bir küresel tehdit olduğunu açıklamıştır. Virusun insanlara esas geçiş yolu Aedes tipi sivrisineklerin ısırmasıdır. İnsanlar arasında transplasental, perinatal, cinsel yolla, ayrıca kan ve vücut sıvıları aracılığı ile bulaşır. ZIKV enfeksiyonu genellikle hafif ve kendini sınırlandıran hastalık olup, düşük derecede ateş, konjuktivit ve periorbital ödem ile seyreder. ZIKV enfeksiyonu esnasında Guillain-Barre sendromu, meningoensefalit, akut dissemine ensefalomyelit (ADEM), akut myelit, transvers myelit gibi nörolojik komplikasyonlar rapor edilmiştir. Intrauterin ve konjenital ZIKV enfeksiyonu fetus üzerinde ağır teratojenik etkiye sahiptir. İntrauterin enfeksiyon mikrosefali, oküler anomaliler (maküler atrofi, pigment beneklenmesi ve optik sinir anomalileri gibi) ve kardiyak anomalilere (atrial veya ventriküler septal defekt gibi) yol açabilir. Beyin gelişim defektleri olarak kortikal ve subkortikal alanda kalsifikasyonlar, vetrikülomegali, serebellar hipoplazi, kortikal/subkortikal atrofi, korpus kallosum hipoplazisi, gecikmiş myelin gelişimi, geniş sisterna magna ve kraniofasiyal orantısızlık bildirilmiştir. ZIKV enfeksiyonu genellikle hafiftir ve tedavi gerektirmez. Fakat hayatın erken döneminde geçirilen enfeksiyonun komplikasyonları ciddidir. Bu yüzden ZIKV’e karşı pekçok ilaç araştırılmakta ve aşı geliştirme çalışmaları yürütülmektedir. Vektör kontrolü ve sivrisinek ısırığından korunmak için kişisel koruyucu önlemler ZIKV enfeksiyonunu azaltmak için önemlidir. Özellikle gebeler, endemik bölgede oturanlar ve seyahat edenler sivrisinek ısırığından dikkatice korunmalıdır.","10.5152/eurasianjmed.2017.17147","","Flavivirus; Guillain-Barré Syndrome; Zika virus; aedes; arbovirus; microcephaly","Journal Article; Review"

[et al]","2017","PURPOSE: To evaluate the global health status of long-term cervical cancer survivors (LCCS) who survived for more than 4 years after curative radiation treatment (RT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 562 women treated with RT in our institution between 2003 and 2010 were reviewed. Excluding 259 women who died of disease or were lost to follow-up, disease status and late morbidities were evaluated in 303 LCCS. Quality of life (QoL) was analyzed in 168 LCCS using a questionnaire from the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer, and the results were compared with an age-matched healthy Korean female population. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 6.8 years (range 4.1-12.5 years). There were 14 deaths (7 cancer specific) and 14 recurrences (5 local recurrences and 9 distant metastases). The median time to recurrence was 6.0 years (range 4.1-8.2 years). Grade ≥2 late toxicities were frequently observed in the bladder (19%) and small/large intestine (15%). Multivariate analysis revealed a higher rate of late toxicity in patients aged ≥51 years at diagnosis (small/large intestine: hazard ratio, HR, 2.5 [1.2-5.5]; bladder: HR 2.4 [1.3-4.5]; and bone: HR 4.3 [1.2-15.8]) than patients aged <51 years. Compared to the general population, LCCS exhibited a significantly higher rate of body image concerns, sexual dysfunction, lymphedema, and peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSION: New recurrences occurred in 5% of LCCS and grade ≥2 treatment-related morbidities were present in 33%. A significant proportion of LCCS also showed decreased cervical-cancer-specific QoL. These results suggest the need for long-term surveillance and follow-up care for LCCS.","10.1007/s00066-017-1143-8","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chemoradiotherapy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Humans; Hysterectomy; Intestines; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Quality of Life; Radiation Injuries; Radiotherapy Dosage; Re-Irradiation; Survival Analysis; Survivors; Urinary Bladder; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","Gynecology; Quality of life; Side effects; Survival; Toxicity","Journal Article"

However, the recent massive ZIKV epidemics in the Americas have also linked ZIKV infection to fetal malformations like microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults, and have uncovered previously unrecognized routes of vertical and sexual transmission. Here we describe inhibition of ZIKV replication by suramin, originally an anti-parasitic drug, which was more recently shown to inhibit multiple viruses. In cell culture-based assays, using reduction of cytopathic effect as read-out, suramin had an EC50 of ∼40 μM and a selectivity index of 48. In single replication cycle experiments, suramin treatment also caused a strong dose-dependent decrease in intracellular ZIKV RNA levels and a >3-log reduction in infectious progeny titers. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that suramin inhibits a very early step of the replication cycle as well as the release of infectious progeny. Only during the first 2 h of infection suramin treatment strongly reduced the fraction of cells that became infected with ZIKV, suggesting the drug affects virus binding/entry. Binding experiments at 4 °C using 35S-labeled ZIKV demonstrated that suramin interferes with attachment to host cells. When suramin treatment was initiated post-entry, viral RNA synthesis was unaffected, while both the release of genomes and the infectivity of ZIKV were reduced. This suggests the compound also affects virion biogenesis, possibly by interfering with glycosylation and the maturation of ZIKV during its traffic through the secretory pathway. The inhibitory effect of suramin on ZIKV attachment and virion biogenesis and its broad-spectrum activity warrant further evaluation of this compound as a potential therapeutic.","10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.04.016","Animals; Chlorocebus aethiops; Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral; DNA Replication; Flavivirus; Glycosylation; Mycophenolic Acid; RNA, Viral; Suramin; Time Factors; Vero Cells; Virion; Virus Attachment; Virus Internalization; Virus Release; Virus Replication; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article"

In 2007, Zika virus appeared outside of its endemic borders in an outbreak on the South Pacific Island of Yap. In 2013, Zika virus was associated with a major neurological complication, Guillain-Barré syndrome, in a larger outbreak in the French Polynesian Islands. From the South Pacific, Zika invaded Brazil in 2015 and caused another severe neurological complication, fetal microcephaly. The mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus can be propagated by sexual transmission and, possibly, by blood transfusions, close personal contacts, and organ transplants, like other flaviviruses. Since these combined mechanisms of infectious disease transmission could result in catastrophic incidences of severe neurological diseases in adults and children, the public should know what to expect from Zika virus, how to prevent infection, and what the most likely failures in preventive measures will be. With federal research funding stalled, a Zika vaccine is far away. The only national strategies to prepare the United States for Zika virus invasion now are effective vector control measures and personal protection from mosquito bites. In addition to a basic knowledge of Aedes mosquito vectors and their biting behaviors, an understanding of simple household vector control measures, and the selection of the best chemical and physical mosquito repellents will be required to repel the Zika threat.","10.1016/j.wem.2016.07.006","Aedes; Animals; Brazil; Female; Humans; Insect Bites and Stings; Male; Mosquito Control; Mosquito Vectors; United States; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes aegypti; Aedes albopictus; Zika virus; arboviruses; mosquito-borne infectious diseases","Editorial"

If symptoms do occur, individuals display a low-grade fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis 2 to 7 d after infection. Infection is concerning due to its associated fetal effects in pregnant women and relationship with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Diagnosis should be suspected in individuals with the appropriate symptomatology and exposure history. Diagnostic tests for the Zika virus are available and vary based on symptom duration.

We examined demographic and travel-related characteristics of returned Canadian travellers with Zika infection acquired in the Americas to illuminate risk factors for acquisition and the clinical spectrum. METHODS: We analyzed demographic and travel-related data for returned Canadian travellers who presented to a CanTravNet site between October 2015 and September 2016 for care of Zika virus acquired in the Americas. Data were collected with use of the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network data platform. RESULTS: During the study period, 1118 travellers presented to a CanTravNet site after returning from the Americas, 41 (3.7%) of whom had Zika infection. Zika infection from the Americas was diagnosed at CanTravNet sites as often as dengue (n = 41) over the study period. In the first half of the study period, Zika virus burden was borne by people visiting friends and relatives in South America. In the latter half, coincident with the increased spread of Zika throughout the Caribbean and Central America, Zika virus occurred more often in tourists in the Caribbean. Forty (98%) of the travellers with Zika infection acquired it through probable mosquito exposure, and 1 had confirmed sexual acquisition. Congenital transmission occurred in 2 of 3 pregnancies. Two (5%) of those with Zika had symptoms resembling those of Guillain-Barré syndrome, 1 of whom also had Zika viral meningitis. INTERPRETATION: Even in this small cohort, we observed the full clinical spectrum of acute Zika virus, including adverse fetal and neurologic outcomes. Our observations suggest that complications from Zika infection are underestimated by data arising exclusively from populations where Zika is endemic.

Additionally, ZIKV has been associated with a number of neurologic complications including microcephaly and other birth defects, Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, and various ophthalmologic abnormalities. Treatment for ZIKV disease is supportive. Those in ZIKV endemic areas should protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing insect repellent, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants when outdoors, and/or using air conditioning or window screens when indoors. Furthermore, unprotected sexual intercourse should be temporarily avoided by those who recently traveled to endemic areas. Suspected ZIKV disease cases should be reported to local, state, or territorial health departments.","10.1007/s11908-017-0557-x","","Arbovirus; Flavivirus; Guillain-Barré syndrome; Neurologic; Zika; Zika virus","Journal Article; Review"

The virus was isolated in 1947 from a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda. The virus causes sporadic mild human infections in Africa and later in Asia. However, by 2007 a major shift in its infection pattern was noticed and thousands of human infections were reported in the State of Yap and Federated States of Micronesia. In the last 3 years, major outbreaks have continued to occur and the virus has spread to several Pacific and American countries. These outbreaks were mostly asymptomatic; however, there were more severe clinical signs associated with the infections. Those signs included microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome. It is believed that various species of mosquitoes can biologically transmit the virus. However, Aedes aegypti is most widely associated with the Zika virus. Recently, new modes of virus transmission have been reported, including mother-to-fetus, sexual, blood transfusion, animal bites, laboratory exposure and breast milk. Differential diagnosis is very important as some other arboviruses such as yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus have similar clinical manifestations to the Zika virus infection as well as relating serologically to some of these viruses. Established laboratory diagnostic tests to detect the Zika virus are limited, with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction being the most widely used test. Taking into consideration the quickness of the spread of infection, size of the infected population and change of the infection severity pattern, the Zika virus infection merits collective efforts on all levels to prevent and control the disease. Limited research work and data, concurrent infection with other arboviruses, involvement of biological vectors, mass crowd events, human and trade movements and lack of vaccines are some of the challenges that we face in our efforts to prevent and control the Zika virus infection. ملخص البحث: تهدف هذه المراجعة إلى تسليط الضوء على فيروس زيكا والذي اكتشف سنة 1947 من قرد الريسوس في غابة الزيكا في أوغندا. يسبب هذا الفيروس عدوى متقطعة لدى الإنسان في بعض الدول الإفريقية والأسيوية. وخلال السنوات الثلاثة الأخيرة حدث انتشار واسع في عدة مناطق أخرى وخاصة في دول أمريكا الوسطى والجنوبية وكان هذا الانتشار مصحوبا ببعض العلامات السريرية الخطيرة كصغر رأس الجنين ومتلازمة غيان بـــــاري (Guillan – Barre syndrome). تقوم بعوضة تدعى (Aedos aegypti) بنقل هذا الفيروس إلى البشر، كما يمكن نقله من الأم إلى الجنين وعن طريق التواصل الجنسي، نقل الدم ومشتقاته وحليب الأم. يناقش الكاتب كيفية التصدي لهذا الفيروس الذي يتطلب تكاتف جماعي وعلى كل المستويات.","10.4103/1658-631X.194260","","Arbovirus; Zika virus; microcephaly; review; zoonotic","Journal Article; Review"

Serology is cross-reactive, laborious, and frequently difficult to interpret, and serum was initially solely recommended for molecular diagnosis. ZKV testing was initiated in January 2016 in New York State for symptomatic patients, pregnant women, their infants, and patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome who had traveled to areas with ZKV transmission. Subsequently, eligibility was expanded to pregnant women with sexual partners with similar travel histories. Serum and urine collected within 4 weeks of symptom onset or within 6 weeks of travel were tested with real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays targeting the ZKV envelope and NS2B genes. In this review of lessons learned from the first 80 positive cases in NYS, ZKV RNA was detected in urine only in 50 patients, in serum only in 19 patients, and in both samples concurrently in 11 patients, with average viral loads in urine a log higher than those in serum. Among 93 positive samples from the 80 patients, 41 were positive on both gene assays, 52 were positive on the envelope only, and none were positive on the NS2B only. Of the 80 infected patients, test results for 74 (93%) would have defined their infection status as not detected or equivocal if the requirement for positive results from two assay targets (two-target-positive requirement) in the initial federal guidance to public health laboratories was enforced, if urine was not tested, or if the extended eligibility time for molecular testing was not implemented. These changes facilitated more extensive molecular diagnosis of ZKV, reducing reliance on time-consuming and potentially inconclusive serology.","10.1128/JCM.01232-16","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New York; Pregnancy; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Serum; Urine; Young Adult; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","diagnostics; emerging pathogens; molecular methods; specimen selection; viral diagnosis","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

Zika is a single-stranded RNA arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family. The primary source of infection in humans stems from Aedes aegypti mosquito bites but can also occur through sexual, blood, and perinatal transmission. With expectations that 3 to 4 million people across the Americas will be infected over the next year, the World Health Organization has declared this event a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. OBSERVATIONS: Although acute Zika virus infection is typically mild and self-limited, researchers have demonstrated serious neurologic complications associated with it such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Otolaryngologists should be aware of head and neck manifestations which include conjunctivitis, retro-orbital pain, cephalgia, and odynophagia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed specific molecular and serologic testing protocols and algorithms for follow-up care of suspected cases. Currently, the mainstay of management is conservative care while researchers attempt to develop a vaccine. Strategies to contain the Zika virus include vector control, travel restriction for women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, and avoidance of mosquito bites in endemic regions of the world. CONCLUSIONS AND REVELANCE: The future outlook regarding the current Zika virus outbreak in the Americas remains uncertain. What is certain is our need to promptly and efficiently address research gaps in our understanding of clinical outcomes from infection and environmental factors that influence emergence meanwhile improving diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive measures against the disease.","10.1001/jamaoto.2016.3427","Clinical Competence; Communicable Disease Control; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Global Health; Humans; Incidence; Male; Needs Assessment; Otolaryngologists; Pregnancy; Risk Assessment; Travel; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Review"

METHODS: This study outlines the clinical features, potential for teratogenicity, diagnosis, and treatment of ZIKV infection. RESULTS: Zika virus is transmitted through the bite of an infected Stegomyia (= Aedes) mosquito, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse, and perinatal routes. Infection has been characterized as mildly symptomatic. Symptoms include mild fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, non-purulent conjunctivitis, and a pruritic maculopapular rash. It is rarely life-threatening, but both Guillain-Barré syndrome and fetal microcephaly have been reported. ZIKV belongs to the same family as bovine viral diarrhea virus, which causes hydrocephalus and microcephaly in newborn calves, and hepatitis C virus, which can be vertically transmitted in human pregnancies, and hence there remains concern for potential similarities. Diagnostic methods include polymerase chain reaction performed in blood samples during infection, and in urine and saliva. Pregnant women undergo antibody testing for immunoglobulin M. Treatment involves supportive care, and acetaminophen and antihistamines to control symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no evidence of the circulation of ZIKV in the Western hemisphere prior to 2014, the global spread of Stegomyia aegypti and increases in urban populations and international travel have fostered its evolution. Adherence to current guidelines for the prevention of ZIKV transmission is especially relevant in regions experiencing ongoing outbreaks.

"27708473","Zika: the origin and spread of a mosquito-borne virus.","Kindhauser MK; Allen T; Frank V; Santhana RS; Dye C","Bulletin of the World Health Organization","2016","OBJECTIVE: To describe the temporal and geographical distribution of Zika virus infection and associated neurological disorders, from 1947 to 1 February 2016, when Zika became a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). METHODS: We did a literature search using the terms ""Zika"" and ""ZIKV"" in PubMed, cross-checked the findings for completeness against other published reviews and added formal notifications to WHO submitted under the International Health Regulations. FINDINGS: From the discovery of Zika virus in Uganda in 1947 to the declaration of a PHEIC by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 1 February 2016, a total of 74 countries and territories had reported human Zika virus infections. The timeline in this paper charts the discovery of the virus (1947), its isolation from mosquitos (1948), the first human infection (1952), the initial spread of infection from Asia to a Pacific island (2007), the first known instance of sexual transmission (2008), reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome (2014) and microcephaly (2015) linked to Zika infections and the first appearance of Zika in the Americas (from 2015). CONCLUSION: Zika virus infection in humans appears to have changed in character as its geographical range has expanded from equatorial Africa and Asia. The change is from an endemic, mosquito-borne infection causing mild illness to one that can cause large outbreaks linked with neurological sequelae and congenital abnormalities. OBJECTIF: Décrire la répartition temporelle et géographique de la maladie à virus Zika et des troubles neurologiques qui lui sont associés de 1947 au 1er février 2016, date à laquelle le virus Zika est devenu une urgence de santé publique de portée internationale (USPPI). MÉTHODES: Nous avons réalisé une recherche bibliographique en saisissant les termes «Zika» et «ZIKV» dans PubMed, puis vérifié par recoupement l'exhaustivité des données recueillies par rapport à d'autres études publiées et ajouté à l'intention de l'OMS des avis formels soumis en vertu du Règlement sanitaire international. RÉSULTATS: De la découverte du virus Zika en Ouganda en 1947 à la déclaration d'une USPPI par l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) le 1er février 2016, 74 pays et territoires ont signalé des cas d'infections humaines par le virus Zika. La chronologie présentée dans cette étude rend compte de la découverte du virus (1947), de son isolement chez des moustiques (1948), de la première infection humaine (1952), de la propagation initiale de l'infection de l'Asie à une île du Pacifique (2007), du premier cas connu de transmission sexuelle (2008), de cas de syndrome de Guillain-Barré (2014) et de microcéphalie (2015) liés à des infections par le virus Zika et de la première apparition du virus Zika sur le continent américain (à partir de 2015). CONCLUSION: L’infection humaine par le virus Zika semble avoir changé de nature à mesure de l'élargissement de sa portée géographique à partir de l'Afrique équatoriale et de l'Asie. Cette infection endémique transmise par des moustiques qui provoquait des symptômes bénins est désormais à l'origine de flambées importantes associées à des séquelles neurologiques et anomalies congénitales. OBJETIVO: Describir la distribución temporal y geográfica de la infección por el virus de Zika y los trastornos neurológicos asociados, del 1947 al 1 de febrero de 2016, cuando el zika se convirtió en una emergencia de salud pública de importancia internacional (ESPII). MÉTODOS: Se realizó un análisis documental utilizando los términos “Zika” y “ZIKV” en PubMed, se realizó una comprobación cruzada de los resultados para analizar su integridad frente a otras publicaciones y se añadieron notificaciones formales a la OMS, emitidas según el Reglamento Sanitario Internacional. RESULTADOS: Desde el descubrimiento del virus de Zika en Uganda en 1947 hasta que la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declaró que se trataba de una ESPII el 1 de febrero de 2016, un total de 74 países y territorios registraron infecciones por el virus de Zika en humanos. El cronograma de este documento enuncia el descubrimiento del virus (1947), su aislamiento de los mosquitos (1948), el primer contagio humano (1952), la primera propagación de la infección de Asia a una isla del Pacífico (2007), el primer caso conocido de transmisión sexual (2008), informes del síndrome de Guillain-Barré (2014) y la microcefalia (2015) asociados a las infecciones de zika y la primera aparición de zika en el continente americano (a partir de 2015). CONCLUSIÓN: La infección por el virus de Zika en humanos parece haber cambiado de naturaleza, conforme su alcance geográfico se ha ampliado del África ecuatorial a Asia. Este cambio se ha producido al pasar de una infección endémica transmitida por mosquitos que provocaba una enfermedad leve a una que puede derivar en grandes brotes vinculados con secuelas neurológicas y anomalías congénitas. الغرض: توضيح التوزيع الزمني والجغرافي لانتشار عدوى فيروس زيكا واضطرابات الجهاز العصبي المرتبطة به، منذ عام 1947 حتى 1 فبراير 2016، عندما أصبح فيروس زيكا يمثل طارئة من طوارئ الصحة العمومية التي تثير قلقًا دوليًا (PHEIC). الطريقة: أجرينا بحثًا في الكتابات باستخدام مصطلحي ""Zika"" و""ZIKV"" في محرك البحث PubMed، وتحققنا من النتائج من حيث اكتمالها بمقارنتها بمراجعات أخرى تم نشرها وأضفنا إخطارات رسمية لمنظمة الصحة العالمية تم تقديمها بموجب اللوائح الصحية الدولية. النتائج: أبلغ عدد من الدول يبلغ في مجمله 74 دولة ومنطقة إقليمية عن وجود حالات للإصابة بعدوى فيروس زيكا، وذلك منذ اكتشاف فيروس زيكا في أوغندا عام 1974 حتى إعلان منظمة الصحة العالمية (WHO) اعتبار الإصابة بهذا الفيروس طارئة من طوارئ الصحة العمومية التي تثير قلقًا دوليًا في 1 فبراير 2016. ويمكن تسجيل مراحل اكتشاف المرض بجدول زمني في هذا التقرير على النحو التالي: اكتشاف الفيروس (1947)، وعزله من الناموس (1948)، وأول إصابة بشرية بالعدوى (1952)، والانتقال الأولي للعدوى من آسيا إلى جزر المحيط الهادئ (2007)، وأول حالة تم التعرف عليها لانتقال العدوى جنسيًا (2008)، والإبلاغ بحالات متلازمة غيّان – باريه (2014) وصغر الرأس (2015) المرتبطة بحالات الإصابة بعدوى زيكا، وأول ظهور لمرض زيكا في الأمريكتين (منذ 2015). الاستنتاج: يبدو أن الإصابة بعدوى فيروس زيكا لدى البشر تغيرت طبيعتها مع اتساع نطاق انتشارها جغرافيًا من المناطق الاستوائية في آسيا وأفريقيا. فقد ظهر التحول من العدوى المتوطنة التي ينقلها البعوض الحامل للفيروس والتي تتسبب في الإصابة بأمراض خفيفة الوطأة إلى عدوى قد تسبب حالات واسعة الانتشار ترتبط بظهور مضاعفات بالجهاز العصبي وتشوهات خلقية. 目的: 描述从 1947 年至 2016 年 2 月 1 日期间，寨卡病毒感染以及相关的神经系统疾病的时间和地理分布。现在，寨卡病毒已成为一项国际公共卫生紧急事件 (PHEIC)。. 方法: 我们在 PubMed 上使用术语“寨卡”和“ZIKV”进行了文献查询，对比其他已发布文献综述交叉检查了结果的完整性，并且按照《国际卫生条例》向世界卫生组织 (WHO) 作出了有关该病毒的正式通知。. 结果: 从寨卡病毒于 1947 年在乌干达被首次发现，到 2016 年 2 月 1 日被世界卫生组织 (WHO) 宣布为国际公共卫生紧急事件 (PHEIC)，已共有 74 个国家和地区报告出现人类寨卡病毒感染病例。该论文中的时间线跟踪记录了该病毒的发现 (1947)、从蚊子体内分离出病毒 (1948)、第一例人类感染 (1952)、从亚洲向太平洋岛屿的首次传播 (2007)、第一例已知的寨卡性传播病例 (2008)、格林-巴利综合症相关报道 (2014)、寨卡病毒感染相关的小头症 (2015) 以及美洲大陆的首例寨卡病例（自 2015 年以来）。. 结论: 人类寨卡病毒感染的特征似乎已经改变，因为其地理范围已经开始从赤道非洲和亚洲逐渐向其他地区扩展。这是一种从引起轻微病症的地方性蚊媒感染向可引起神经系统后遗症和先天性畸形的大规模疫情的转变。. ЦЕЛЬ: Описать временное и территориальное распределение заражения вирусом Зика и сопряженных неврологических нарушений с 1947 года до 1 февраля 2016 года, когда вирус Зика получил статус чрезвычайной ситуации в области общественного здравоохранения, имеющей международное значение (PHEIC). МЕТОДЫ: Авторы выполнили поиск литературы с условиями поиска Zika и ZIKV (вирус Зика) в базе данных PubMed, подвергли результаты перекрестной сверке с результатами других опубликованных анализов, чтобы убедиться в их полноте, и добавили официальные уведомления для ВОЗ, которые были представлены в соответствии с международными медико-санитарными правилами. РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: С момента обнаружения вируса Зика в Уганде в 1947 году до провозглашения Всемирной организацией здравоохранения (ВОЗ) 1 февраля 2016 года чрезвычайной ситуации в области общественного здравоохранения, имеющей международное значение (PHEIC), случаи заражения человека вирусом Зика были зарегистрированы в общей сложности в 74 странах и регионах. Хронология в данном документе включает обнаружение вируса (1947 год), его выделение из комаров (1948 год), первое заражение человека (1952 год), первоначальное распространение инфекции из Азии в Океанию (2007 год), первый известный случай передачи вируса половым путем (2008 год), сообщения о синдроме Гийена-Барре (2014 год) и микроцефалии (2015 год), связанных с заражениями вирусом Зика, и первое появление вируса Зика в Америке (с 2015 года). ВЫВОД: Судя по всему, характер заражения людей вирусом Зика изменился с расширением его географического распространения из экваториальной Африки и Азии. Эндемическая, переносимая комарами инфекция, которая вызывает болезнь, протекающую в легкой форме, трансформировалась в инфекцию, способную вызывать масштабные вспышки, связанные с неврологическими последствиями и врожденными аномалиями.","10.2471/BLT.16.171082","Aedes; Africa; Animals; Asia; Disease Outbreaks; Geography; Global Health; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Macaca mulatta; Microcephaly; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Historical Article; Journal Article"

This obscure virus was limited to sporadic cases in Africa and Asia, until the emergence of Zika virus in Brazil in 2015, when it rapidly spread throughout the Americas. Most Zika virus infections are subclinical or characterized by mild febrile illness. However, neurological complications, including Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults, and congenital anomalies, including microcephaly in babies born to infected mothers, raised a grave concern. Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available for Zika virus infection. Thus, international public health response is primarily focused on preventing infection, particularly in pregnant women, and on providing up-to-date recommendations to reduce the risk of non-vector transmission of Zika virus. Zika je virus iz rodu flavivirusov, ki se prenaša s komarjevim pikom, in predstavlja javnozdravstveno grožnjo v trenutni epidemiji. Ta nepoznan virus je bil omejen na sporadične primere v Afriki in Aziji vse do pojava v Braziliji leta 2015, ko se je bliskovito razširil v obeh Amerikah. Večina okužb z virusom Zika je subkliničnih in se kažejo kot blaga bolezen z vročinskim stanjem.

METHODS: Electronic databases of PubMed, WHO, CDC, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Google, and Cochrane library were extensively searched for ZIKV. Articles were reviewed, scrutinized and critically appraised and the most relevant articles were utilized. RESULTS: ZIKV is an emerging Flavivirus which was first isolated from Uganda in 1947. It is transmitted mainly through bite of Aedes mosquitoes. Sexual, perinatal and blood-borne transmissions are implicated. ZIKV is incriminated to cause microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. The spiky spread of ZIKV and its epidemic potential are especially problematic in countries which host big MGs with endogenous ZIKV circulation. This put millions of international travelers and local inhabitants at risk of acquiring ZIKV, especially in absence of vaccine until now. Brazil Olympic and Paralympics Games, and Muslims Hajj in Saudi Arabia are important upcoming MGs. Regarding Brazil, swiftly epidemic of ZIKV causes phobia and provokes claims and counter-claims about possible postponing or cancellation of such events. RECOMMENDATIONS: Intensifying ZIKV epidemiological surveillance (sentinel, syndromic, environmental, laboratory and electronic), and conduction of educational programs are required. Controlling Aedes vector (chemically & biologically) is essential. Multidisciplinary cooperation is required to win the war against ZIKV.","10.12669/pjms.324.10038","","Emerging diseases; Epidemiology; Mass gathering; Phobia; Preparedness; Surveillance; Vaccine trials; Zika","Journal Article; Review"

Morbidity and mortality weekly report","2016","Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus primarily transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (1). Zika virus infections have also been documented through intrauterine transmission resulting in congenital infection; intrapartum transmission from a viremic mother to her newborn; sexual transmission; blood transfusion; and laboratory exposure (1-5). Most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic (1,6). Clinical illness, when it occurs, is generally mild and characterized by acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or nonpurulent conjunctivitis. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause adverse outcomes such as fetal loss, and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies (1-3). Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare autoimmune condition affecting the peripheral nervous system, also has been associated with Zika virus infection (1). Following the identification of local transmission of Zika virus in Brazil in May 2015, the virus has continued to spread throughout the Region of the Americas, and travel-associated cases have increased (7). In 2016, Zika virus disease and congenital infections became nationally notifiable conditions in the United States (8). As of September 3, 2016, a total of 2,382 confirmed and probable cases of Zika virus disease with symptom onset during January 1-July 31, 2016, had been reported from 48 of 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Most cases (2,354; 99%) were travel-associated, with either direct travel or an epidemiologic link to a traveler to a Zika virus-affected area. Twenty-eight (1%) cases were reported as locally acquired, including 26 associated with mosquito-borne transmission, one acquired in a laboratory, and one with an unknown mode of transmission. Zika virus disease should be considered in patients with compatible clinical signs or symptoms who traveled to or reside in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission or who had unprotected sex with someone who traveled to those areas. Health care providers should continue to educate patients, especially pregnant women, about the importance of avoiding infection with Zika virus, and all pregnant women should be assessed for possible Zika virus exposure at each prenatal visit (2).","10.15585/mmwr.mm6536e5","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; District of Columbia; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Travel; United States; Young Adult; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article"

The virus has emerged in recent years and spread in the Pacific Area and the Americas, where it has caused large human outbreaks. The factors involved in the virus's emergence are still unknown, but probably include its introduction in naïve environments characterised by the presence of high densities of competent Aedes spp. mosquitoes and susceptible human hosts in urban areas. Unique features of Zika virus infection are sexual and transplacental transmission and associated neurological morbidities, i.e. Guillain-Barré syndrome and fetal microcephaly. Diagnosis relies on the detection of viral nucleic acids in biological samples, while detection of a specific antibody response may be inconclusive because of the broad cross-reactivity of antibodies among flaviviruses. Experimental studies have clarified some mechanisms of Zika virus pathogenesis and have identified potential targets for antiviral drugs. In animal models, the virus can infect and efficiently replicate in the placenta and in the brain, and induce fetal demise or neural damage, recapitulating human diseases. These animal models have been used to evaluate candidate vaccines and promising results have been obtained.","10.1093/femsle/fnw202","","Zika virus; antiviral drugs; clinical features; diagnosis; pathogenesis; transmission; vaccines","Review; Journal Article"

Virus is closely related with other flaviviruses; dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus phylogenetically. Due to the possible relationship between virus and clinical features including microcephaly, ventricule, and eye deformities, Guillain-Barre syndrome increases the interest on this virus gradually. Along with the vector-borne transmission, exposure via blood transfusion and sexual contact are further concerns. Since December 2015, CDC reported 440.000-1.300.000 possible cases in Brazil and as of 19 January 2016, El Salvador, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Surinam, French Guana, Honduras, Mexico, and Panama are the countries with active epidemic. CDC recommends ZIKV screening for all pregnants including asymptomatic cases those living in the active epidemic areas. Recently, virus is detected in the USA and most European countries including UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, and Italy as a travel-associated infection. Owing to the changing world with increased capabilities for transportation globally, this vector-borne infection represents a valuable marker for the ability of spreading of any infection from its original area that it was first seen.

World Health Organization declared the current outbreak as the public health emergency of international concerns. The major route of Zika virus transmission is mosquito bites. Sexual transmission and monkey bites are also observed in few cases. There is dire need to evaluate the other routes of transmission like blood transfusion, lactation and contact with body fluids. Zika virus is infecting infants, not only causing microcephaly but also creating number of complications resulting in bad outcomes of pregnancy. In Brazil alone, 4000 cases of microcephaly have observed during the current outbreak. The incidence of Guillain-Barre (GB) syndrome is also observed during the current Zika virus outbreak. GB syndrome is acute medical condition leading the patients to death due to weakness of respiratory muscles or can cause the life time disability. There is no anti-viral drug or vaccine available for Zika virus. Zika infection can be prevented by using mosquito repellents, mosquito nets, cooling rooms by air conditions and wearing full sleeves or permethrin-treated clothes.

Since January 2015, 41 countries reported autochthonous cases. In Brazil, an increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly cases was linked to ZIKV infections. A recent report describing low experimental transmission efficiency of its main putative vector, Ae. aegypti, in conjunction with apparent sexual transmission notifications, prompted the investigation of other potential sources of viral dissemination. Urine and saliva have been previously established as useful tools in ZIKV diagnosis. Here, we described the presence and isolation of infectious ZIKV particles from saliva and urine of acute phase patients in the Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nine urine and five saliva samples from nine patients from Rio de Janeiro presenting rash and other typical Zika acute phase symptoms were inoculated in Vero cell culture and submitted to specific ZIKV RNA detection and quantification through, respectively, NAT-Zika, RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. Two ZIKV isolates were achieved, one from urine and one from saliva specimens. ZIKV nucleic acid was identified by all methods in four patients. Whenever both urine and saliva samples were available from the same patient, urine viral loads were higher, corroborating the general sense that it is a better source for ZIKV molecular diagnostic. In spite of this, from the two isolated strains, each from one patient, only one derived from urine, suggesting that other factors, like the acidic nature of this fluid, might interfere with virion infectivity. The complete genome of both ZIKV isolates was obtained. Phylogenetic analysis revealed similarity with strains previously isolated during the South America outbreak. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The detection of infectious ZIKV particles in urine and saliva of patients during the acute phase may represent a critical factor in the spread of virus. The epidemiological relevance of this finding, regarding the contribution of alternative non-vectorial ZIKV transmission routes, needs further investigation.","10.1371/journal.pntd.0004816","Adult; Aged; Brazil; Female; Genome, Viral; Humans; Middle Aged; Phylogeny; Pregnancy; RNA, Viral; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Saliva; Young Adult; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article"

More than one million people have been infected since the appearance of the virus in Brazil in 2015. Approximately 80% of infected patients are asymptomatic. An association with microcephaly and other birth defects as well as Guillain-Barre Syndrome has led to a World Health Organization declaration of Zika virus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Zika virus is a vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Male to female sexual transmission has been reported and there is potential for transmission via blood transfusions. After an incubation period of 2-7 days, symptomatic patients develop rapid onset fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis, often associated with headache and myalgias. Emergency department (ED) personnel must be prepared to address concerns from patients presenting with symptoms consistent with acute Zika virus infection, especially those who are pregnant or planning travel to Zika-endemic regions, as well as those women planning to become pregnant and their partners. The identify-isolate-inform (3I) tool, originally conceived for initial detection and management of Ebola virus disease patients in the ED, and later adjusted for measles and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, can be adapted for real-time use for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I tool for initial detection and management of patients under investigation for Zika virus. Following an assessment of epidemiologic risk, including travel to countries with mosquitoes that transmit Zika virus, patients are further investigated if clinically indicated. If after a rapid evaluation, Zika or other arthropod-borne diseases are the only concern, isolation (contact, droplet, airborne) is unnecessary. Zika is a reportable disease and thus appropriate health authorities must be notified. The modified 3I tool will facilitate rapid analysis and triggering of appropriate actions for patients presenting to the ED at risk for Zika.","10.5811/westjem.2016.3.30188","Communicable Disease Control; Decision Support Techniques; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Male; Patient Isolation; Population Surveillance; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Travel; World Health Organization; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article"

In addition to the vector-mediated transmission of Zika fever, probable human-to-human transmission through exchange of body fluids, including sexual and perinatal transmission and through blood transfusion, makes containment of this new entity more challenging. Moreover, a high index of suspicion by an astute physician is necessary for diagnosis of Zika fever in view of the similarity of symptoms with dengue and chikungunya, especially in areas, where these two diseases are already endemic. Zika, till recently, has had minimal impact, but its true potential is unfolding with increasing detection of congenital malformities, Guillain-Barré syndrome and other neurological and autoimmune syndromes in patients with recent history of ZIKV infection, or when mothers get infected with Zika during first or second trimester of pregnancy.

The extent of spread depends on the travel volume and the endemicity in the exporting country. In the absence of reliable surveillance data, we did mathematical modelling to estimate the number of importations of ZIKV from Brazil into Europe. DESIGN: We applied a previously developed mathematical model on importations of dengue to estimate the number of ZIKV importations into Europe, based on the travel volume, the probability of being infected at the time of travel, the population size of Brazil, and the estimated incidence of ZIKV infections. RESULTS: Our model estimated between 508 and 1,778 imported infections into Europe in 2016, of which we would expect between 116 and 355 symptomatic Zika infections; with the highest number of importations being into France, Portugal and Italy. CONCLUSIONS: Our model identified high-risk countries in Europe. Such data can assist policymakers and public health professionals in estimating the extent of importations in order to prepare for the scale up of laboratory diagnostic assays and estimate the occurrence of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, potential sexual transmission, and infants with congenital ZIKV syndrome.","10.3402/gha.v9.31669","","Brazil; Europe; Zika virus; importations; travel","Journal Article"

OBSERVATIONS: In this review, we discuss what is currently known about ZIKV, neuroimmunologic complications, and the impact on global human health. Zika virus spread across Africa and Asia in part owing to unique genomic evolutionary conditions and pressures resulting in specific human disease manifestations, complications, and pathogenesis. Recent data suggest that acute ZIKV infection in pregnant women may result in acute infection of fetal tissue and brain tissue, causing microcephaly and potentially severe debilitation of the infant or even death of the fetus. Cases of acute ZIKV are also associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. With the increased number of cases, new complications such as ocular involvement and sexual transmission have been reported. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Zika virus is an emerging viral pathogen with significant consequences on human health throughout the world. Ongoing research into this pathogen is urgently needed to produce viable vaccine and therapeutic options.","10.1001/jamaneurol.2016.0800","Animals; Female; Humans; Male; Nervous System Diseases; Pregnancy; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Review"

Although more than 60 years have passed since the discovery and first reported human cases of the virus, only a small number (< 10) of cases had been encountered in the literature until the last 10 years. Zika virus was known as a virus which caused sporadic infections and was confined to Africa and Asia along a narrow equatorial line. In 2007, however, the first major outbreak of ZIKV occurred in Yap Island (Micronesia), and so it was reported for the first time outside of Africa and Asia. Between the years of 2007 and 2014, ZIKV spreaded to island groups located in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean, and in 2015-2016, it has spread to South and Central America and the Caribbean. Today, travel-related imported cases is still been reported in Europe, North America, and other countries in the Far East. According to the data from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of March 2016, ZIKV infections have already spread locally in more than 30 countries, and travel alerts have been issued for the countries where the virus is present. Zika virus infections are generally asymptomatic or may present with a moderate clinical picture (e.g. acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, and nonpurulent conjunctivitis). Although no deaths were attributed to ZIKV infection over the past 60 years, as of November 2015, it has been suggested that three deaths in Brazil, including the death of a newborn with microcephaly, may be attributed to ZIKV infection. In addition, concurrent with outbreaks in 2013 in French Polynesia and in 2015 in Brazil, there have been significant rises reported in the incidence of some autoimmune and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly; these reports have caused considerable international concern. There are many points that are still unclear about ZIKV, including: (1) intrauterine transmission risk, frequency, and effects of the infection on fetal development; (2) the probability of perinatal transmission and if so the possible risks; (3) association with autoimmune and neurological diseases, and presence of long-term sequelae risks after infection; (4) possible routes of transmission other than mosquito bites, such as sexual contact, blood transfusion, and other body fluids (saliva, semen, or urine); (5) presence of reservoir(s) and different mosquito vectors; (6) diagnostic difficulties including cross reactivity in serological tests and standardization of testing procedures; (7) severity of the infection in immunocompromised patients; and (8) the potential effectiveness of antiviral therapy or preventive vaccines. In this review, updated information and recommendations regarding ZIKV outbreaks and risks, and the epidemiology, diagnosis and characteristics of ZIKV infections, are summarized in light of the most recent literature.","10.5578/mb.24167","Epidemics; Global Health; Humans; Risk Factors; Zika Virus Infection","","English Abstract; Journal Article; Review"

With the ease of worldwide travel, this disease has spread rapidly to the U.S. OBJECTIVES: To provide physicians with an updated clinical review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, and mimics of zika virus. DISCUSSION: This flavivirus is spread by the bite of the Aedes mosquito during daylight. The ease of worldwide travel has allowed the virus to spread to Mexico and the U.S. Main transmission route is via blood contact or sexual activity involving mucous membranes. Incubation ranges from 2 to 12 days, but only 20% of patients experience symptoms. Fever is low grade with conjunctivitis, arthralgias, myalgias, and a maculopapular rash. Chikungunya and Dengue Fever differ in that patients experience higher fever and no conjunctivitits. The dreaded complication of Zika virus is microcephaly in infants born to infected mothers. Guillain-Barre Syndrome is also linked to the virus. Historical factors including travel history are paramount, and diagnosis includes PCR or serology. No current treatment regimen exists beyond symptom control. The emergency physician must seek to rule out other similar diseases such as malaria, chikungunya, and dengue fever. CONCLUSION: Zika virus has created public fear due to complications, and this flavivirus spread by the Aedes mosquito presents similarly to Chikungunya and Dengue Fever. The dreaded complication of Zika virus is microcephaly in infants born to infected mothers. This review provides key information concerning the disease and management.","10.1016/j.jemermed.2016.03.033","Animals; Culicidae; Diagnosis, Differential; Education, Medical, Continuing; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Insect Vectors; United States; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes; Zika virus; blood; flavivirus; microcephaly; mosquito","Journal Article"

This report provides an update to the epidemiology of and public health response to ongoing Zika virus transmission in Puerto Rico. During November 1, 2015-April 14, 2016, a total of 6,157 specimens from suspected Zika virus-infected patients were evaluated by the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) and CDC Dengue Branch (which is located in San Juan, Puerto Rico), and 683 (11%) had laboratory evidence of current or recent Zika virus infection by one or more tests: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Zika virus-infected patients resided in 50 (64%) of 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico. Median age was 34 years (range = 35 days-89 years). The most frequently reported signs and symptoms were rash (74%), myalgia (68%), headache (63%), fever (63%), and arthralgia (63%). There were 65 (10%) symptomatic pregnant women who tested positive by RT-PCR or IgM ELISA. A total of 17 (2%) patients required hospitalization, including 5 (1%) patients with suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome. One (<1%) patient died after developing severe thrombocytopenia. The public health response to the outbreak has included increased laboratory capacity to test for Zika virus infection (including blood donor screening), implementation of enhanced surveillance systems, and prevention activities focused on pregnant women. Vector control activities include indoor and outdoor residual spraying and reduction of mosquito breeding environments focused around pregnant women's homes. Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should continue to employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission (5), and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever.","10.15585/mmwr.mm6517e2","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Pregnancy; Public Health Practice; Puerto Rico; Young Adult; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article"

Currently, a large outbreak is occurring predominantly located in the Americas. ZIKV infection is a cause of microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities and can cause post-infectious neurologic complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To review current knowledge of ZIKV infection and to provide guidance to health care professionals who provide advice to Canadians who may be impacted by ZIKV infection. METHODS: This Statement was developed by a working group of the Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT). Recommendations are based on a literature review and clinical judgment. RESULTS: All travellers should use personal protective measures against mosquito bites including insect repellents and protection of living areas against mosquito entry. Pregnant women should avoid travel to areas designated by the Public Health Agency of Canada as being of concern because of ongoing ZIKV transmission. Women planning a pregnancy should consult with their health care provider and consider postponing travel to these areas. All other travellers may wish to consider deferring travel to designated areas based on risk tolerance, values, and preferences.​: Sexual transmission of ZIKV from male partners has been documented and couples should practise abstinence or use condoms for the duration of a pregnancy, while in a risk area, or until viral shedding has likely ceased. In the absence of clear data, we make the assumption that viral shedding is unlikely to persist beyond 6 months for men and two months for non-pregnant women.​: Health care providers should take a travel history from their pregnant patients including relevant information related to the travel history of their partner(s). Screening and management recommendations are provided for all travellers including potentially contagious male partners, pregnant women (symptomatic and asymptomatic), and the fetus or infant of potentially infected women. There is no specific antiviral therapy for the treatment of ZIKV infection. CONCLUSION: Robust quantitative assessments for the full spectrum of ZIKV-associated risks are not possible. This reflects, among other things, uncertainties related to the likelihood of infection among travellers to ZIKV-affected areas, vertical transmission from mother to fetus, sexual transmission (from symptomatic or asymptomatic partners), and serious ZIKV-associated sequelae among travellers. Given this uncertainty, as well as the potentially severe effects of ZIKV infection on the fetus, recommendations are conservative. CATMAT will update its recommendations as new information becomes available.","10.14745/ccdr.v42i05a01","","","Journal Article"

By the end of February, the CDC had confirmed 147 Zika cases in U.S. residents who had traveled to Zika-endemic areas. While symptoms of Zika tend to be mild, the virus has been linked to serious birth defects, so public health efforts are focused primarily at mitigating the risk Zika poses to pregnant women. By mid-February, nine pregnant women who had traveled to Zika-endemic areas and contracted the virus had been reported to the CDC. Of these, four pregnancies ended in miscarriage or termination, and one child was born with microcephaly. While Zika is transmitted primarily via mosquito bites, the CDC is investigating more than a dozen reported cases of Zika transmitted via sexual contact. Public health authorities say Zika can trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome in a small number of infections. For frontline clinicians, travel history is key to identifying potential cases of Zika in pregnant women who may have been exposed.

Data sources were from peer review articles and WHO documents. The sources of Zika virus infection would include patients, people with asymptomatic infections and primates. The infectious period of Zika virus remains unclear. However, according to the period that RNA of Zika virus can be positively detected in blood, saliva, urine or semen, we can presume that the communicable period may last for 2 months or even longer.

However, increasing evidence supports a link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes (1), and a possible association between recent Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome has been reported (2). Although Zika virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of Aedes species of mosquitoes, sexual transmission also has been documented (3). Zika virus RNA has been detected in a number of body fluids, including blood, urine, saliva, and amniotic fluid (3-5), and whereas transmission associated with occupational exposure to these body fluids is theoretically possible, it has not been documented. Although there are no reports of transmission of Zika virus from infected patients to health care personnel or other patients, minimizing exposures to body fluids is important to reduce the possibility of such transmission. CDC recommends Standard Precautions in all health care settings to protect both health care personnel and patients from infection with Zika virus as well as from blood-borne pathogens (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and hepatitis C virus [HCV]) (6). Because of the potential for exposure to large volumes of body fluids during the labor and delivery process and the sometimes unpredictable and fast-paced nature of obstetrical care, the use of Standard Precautions in these settings is essential to prevent possible transmission of Zika virus from patients to health care personnel.","10.15585/mmwr.mm6511e3","Delivery of Health Care; Delivery, Obstetric; Education, Medical, Continuing; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Occupational Diseases; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Teaching; United States; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article"

"26969497","The Convergence of a Virus, Mosquitoes, and Human Travel in Globalizing the Zika Epidemic.","Imperato PJ","Journal of community health","2016","The Zika virus was first identified in 1947 in the Zika Forest of Uganda. It was discovered in a rhesus monkey that had been placed in a cage on a sentinel platform in the forest by the Virus Research Institute. When this writer visited the institute and the Zika Forest in 1961, work was underway to identify mosquito species at various levels of the tree canopy. This was done through the placement of traps at various levels of a 120-foot-high steel tower which this writer climbed. At that time, researchers isolated 12 strains of Zika virus from traps on the tower. Over the next six decades, the virus spread slowly to other parts of Africa, and eventually appeared in Southeast Asia, transmitted by Aedes aegypti and other Aedes mosquito species. By 1981, only 14 cases of illness had been reported as due to the Zika virus. Since most infections with this virus are either mild or asymptomatic, its true geographic spread was not fully appreciated. The current globalization of the Zika epidemic began on the Pacific island of Yap in the Federated States of Polynesia in 2007. This was the first known presence of the Zika virus outside of Africa and Southeast Asia. It was estimated that 73 % of the island's population had been infected. In 2013, the virus spread to French Polynesia where an estimated 28,000 cases occurred in a population of 270,000. During that year and afterwards, microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities were observed in the infants of women who were pregnant when they contracted the virus. It is currently not known if cases of microcephaly have resulted from infection of pregnant women or from infection plus some other co-factor. The epidemic rapidly spread to the Cook Islands and Easter Island. In 2015, Zika virus infection was diagnosed in Brazil where it was associated with microcephaly in the infants of some women who were pregnant when they contracted the disease. Cases of the Guillain-Barré syndrome were also found to be associated with Zika virus infection. How the disease entered Brazil is a matter of conjecture. However, the strain responsible for the epidemic in Brazil and elsewhere in South and Central America is phylogenetically identical to that which caused the epidemic in French Polynesia. The wide distribution of Aedes aegypti, a principal vector of the virus, and other Aedes species has greatly facilitated the spread of the disease. Aedes aegypti is an invasive species of mosquito in the Western Hemisphere that has adapted well to densely-populated urban environments. In addition, male-to-female human sexual transmission has increasingly been demonstrated in the US and elsewhere. In February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current Zika outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern. On the recommendation of its Emergency Committee on Zika Virus and Observed Increase in Neurological Disorders and Neonatal Malformations, WHO issued a group of recommendations to contain the epidemic. The globalization of the Zika virus was made possible by the widespread presence in various parts of the world of Aedes vectors and increased human travel that facilitated geographic spread. This globalization of Zika follows upon that of West Nile, Ebola, Dengue, and Chikungunya. Its ultimate spread is difficult to predict, but will hopefully be restricted through vigorous preventive measures.","10.1007/s10900-016-0177-7","Aedes; Animals; Epidemics; Global Health; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Mosquito Vectors; Travel; Uganda; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes aegypti; Guillain-Barré syndrome; Kisubi Catholic Mission; Microcephaly; Zika Forest and Pascal James Imperato; Zika virus; Zika virus and travel; Zika virus infection","Historical Article; Journal Article; Review"
"26925496","The Zika outbreak of the 21st century.","Chang C; Ortiz K; Ansari A; Gershwin ME","Journal of autoimmunity","2016","The Zika virus outbreak has captivated the attention of the global audience and information has spread rapidly and wildly through the internet and other media channels. This virus was first identified in 1947, when it was isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey placed by British scientists working at the Yellow Fever Research Laboratory located in the Zika forest area of Uganda, hence its name, and is transmitted primarily by the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The fact that the rhesus macaque is an Asian species being placed in an African forest brings to mind the possibility of rapid adaptation of the virus from an African to Asian species, an issue that has not been considered. Whether such adaptation has played any role in acquiring pathogenicity due to cross species transmission remains to be identified. The first human infection was described in Nigeria in 1954, with only scattered reports of about a dozen human infections identified over a 50-year period. It was not until 2007 that Zika virus raised its ugly head with infections noted in three-quarters of the population on the tiny island of Yap located between the Philippines and Papua New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean, followed by a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013. The virus remained confined to a narrow equatorial band in Africa and Asia until 2014 when it began to spread eastward, first toward Oceania and then to South America. Since then, millions of infected individuals have been identified in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, including 25 additional countries in the Americas. While the symptoms associated with Zika virus infection are generally mild, consisting of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, there have been reports of more severe reactions that are associated with neurological complications. In pregnant women, fetal neurological complications include brain damage and microcephaly, while in adults there have been several cases of virus-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome. The virus was until recently believed to only be transmitted via mosquitoes. But when the Zika virus was isolated from the semen specimens from a patient in Texas, this provided the basis for the recent report of possible sexual transmission of the Zika virus. Due to the neurological complications, various vectors for infection as well as the rapid spread throughout the globe, it has prompted the World Health Organization to issue a global health emergency. Various governmental organizations have recommended that pregnant women do not travel to countries where the virus is epidemic, and within the countries affected by the virus, recommendations were provided for women of childbearing age to delay pregnancy. The overall public health impact of these above findings highlights the need for a rapid but specific diagnostic test for blood banks worldwide to identify those infected and for the counseling of women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy. As of this date, there are neither commercially licensed diagnostic tests nor a vaccine. Because cross-reactivity of the Zika virus with dengue and Chikungunya virus is common, it may pose difficulty in being able to quickly develop such tests and vaccines. So far the most effective public health measures include controlling the mosquito populations via insecticides and preventing humans from direct exposure to mosquitoes.","10.1016/j.jaut.2016.02.006","Animals; Communicable Disease Control; Disease Management; Disease Outbreaks; Global Health; History, 21st Century; Humans; Population Surveillance; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes aegypti; Arborvirus; Autophagy; Centrosome; Dengue; Flavivirus; Glycosylation; Guillain-Barre; Microcephaly; Mosquitoes; Pandemic; Sexual transmission; Zika fever","Historical Article; Journal Article"

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In total, 744 patients at a median follow-up of 21 months were included. QoL was prospectively assessed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life core module 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC cervical cancer module 24 (CX24) questionnaires at baseline, then every 3 months during the first year, every 6 months in the second and third years, and finally yearly thereafter in patients with no evidence of disease. Outcomes were evaluated over time and compared to those from an age-matched female reference population. RESULTS: General QoL and emotional and social functioning were impaired at baseline but improved during the first 6 months after treatment, to reach a level comparable to that of the reference population, whereas cognitive functioning remained impaired. Both social and role functioning showed the lowest scores at baseline but which increased after treatment to reach a plateau at 6 months and then declined slightly at 3 and 4 years. The overall symptom experience was elevated at baseline and decreased to a level within the range of that of the reference population. Similarly, tumor-related symptoms (eg, pain, appetite loss, and constipation), which were present before treatment, decreased substantially at the first follow-up after treatment. Several treatment-related symptoms developed either immediately after and persisted over time (diarrhea, menopausal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and sexual functioning problems) or developed gradually after treatment (lymphedema and dyspnea). CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal prospective QoL analysis showed that patients' general QoL and functioning were impaired before treatment compared to those of reference data. Several tumor-related symptoms resolved after treatment, and functioning and general QoL returned to that of the level of the reference population, indicating a transient impact of diagnosis and treatment. However, several treatment-related symptoms and problems did develop and persist, either immediately or gradually after treatment.","10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.12.363","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brachytherapy; Chemoradiotherapy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Humans; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy, Image-Guided; Recovery of Function; Sexual Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Young Adult","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Quality of life has not been clearly defined up to date, although it is clear that it is a subjective self-assessment that to a significant extent is determined by individual needs, beliefs, values, attitudes, which are changing with time. Health-related QoL comprises basic dimensions such as patients' performance status, physical, emotional, and social functioning, symptoms of the disease and adverse effects of treatment, spiritual (God and existential) and other dimensions. In women, the ovary, cervical, corpus uterus, vagina and vulva cancers deteriorate QoL by disease progression and consequences of treatment, also in cancer survivors. Common symptoms include the genito-urinary system, the lower gastrointestinal tract and peripheral neuropathies induced by chemotherapy. In young women, QoL is impaired by infertility, sexual problems and menopause symptoms. An overview of QoL questionnaires used in oncology with special regard to patients with gynecological tumors was conducted. A screening tool for psychological state assessment of oncology patients (distress thermometer), the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and modular approach of QoL assessment recommended by the EORTC (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer) were presented. Practical guidelines were proposed to assess appropriately QoL in patients with gynecological cancers who stay at in-patient gynecology units and those treated at home and in an ambulatory care setting.","10.5114/pm.2015.56539","","gynecological cancer; oncology; quality of life; supportive care; symptoms","Journal Article; Review"

A Video Vignette Study.","Ngune I; Jiwa M; McManus A; Parsons R; Pagey G; Hodder R","Journal of medical Internet research","2015","BACKGROUND: Patients who have been treated for colorectal cancer in Australia can consult their general practitioner (GP) for advice about symptoms or side effects at any time following their treatment. However, there is no evidence that such patients are consistently advised by GPs, and patients experience substantial unmet need for reassurance and advice. OBJECTIVE: To explore the patient management options selected by GPs to treat a set of patients describing their symptoms following treatment for colorectal cancer. METHODS: This was an Internet-based survey. Participants (GPs) viewed 6 video vignettes of actors representing patients who had been treated for colorectal cancer. The actor-patients presented problems that resulted from their treatment. Participants indicated their diagnosis and stated if they would prescribe, refer, or order tests, based on that diagnosis. These responses were then rated against the management decisions for those vignettes as recommended by a team of colorectal cancer experts. RESULTS: In total, 52 GPs consented to take part in the study, and 40 (77%) completed the study. Most GPs made a diagnosis of colorectal cancer treatment side effects/symptoms of recurrence that was consistent with the experts' opinions. However, correct diagnosis was dependent on the type of case viewed. Compared with radiation proctitis, GPs were more likely to recognize peripheral neuropathy (odds ratio, OR, 4.43, 95% CI 1.41-13.96, P=.011) and erectile dysfunction (OR 9.70, 95% CI 2.48-38.03, P=.001), but less likely to identify chemotherapy-induced fatigue (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08-0.44). GPs who had more hours of direct patient care (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.84, P=.02), were experienced (OR 9.78, 95% CI 1.18-8.84, P=.02), and consulted more patients per week (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.16-5.30, P=.02) suggested a management plan that was consistent with the expert opinion. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, years of experience and direct patient contact hours had a significant and positive impact on the management of patients. This study also showed promising results indicating that management of the common side effects of colorectal cancer treatment can be delegated to general practice. Such an intervention could support the application of shared models of care. However, a larger study, including the management of side effects in real patients, needs to be conducted before this can be safely recommended.","10.2196/jmir.4942","Adult; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease Management; Female; General Practitioners; Humans; Internet; Male; Pilot Projects","Internet survey; colorectal cancer; general practice; side effects; video vignettes","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

CASE REPORTS: We report two new cases of HAM/TSP in Caucasians, native from Galicia, Spain. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, clinical neurophysiologic studies and brain and spinal cord MRI scans were performed. Both patients presented a progressive chronic myelopathy, evolving to spastic paraparesis; one of them presenting with uveitis, prior to the onset of neurological symptoms. CSF analysis revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased protein concentration with positive anti-HTLV-1 antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction was positive for HTLV-1. Oligoclonal bands were not detected. In one of the patients, MRI scans did not reveal abnormalities whilst in the other there was an elongated high intensity lesion at the thoracic spinal cord level, which resolved after treatment. No evidence of peripheral neuropathy was found. Corticosteroids and interferon alpha therapy was started, with moderate functional improvement. A history of unprotected sexual relationships while travelling to HTLV-1 endemic areas was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1-associated uveitis may predict HAM/TSP. HAM/TSP is probably an underdiagnosed disease due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, insidious clinical presentation and low suspicion index in non-endemic regions for HTLV-1. In non-tropical countries, HAM/TSP should not only be suspected in migrants from endemic areas for HTLV-1, but also in patients from communities with a tradition of migration to tropical countries. TITLE: Paraparesia espastica tropical en una region no tropical. UNLABELLED: Introduccion. El virus linfotropo humano de celulas T tipo 1 (HTLV-1) es el agente causal de la paraparesia espastica tropical. Su prevalencia, elevada en determinadas areas tropicales, es baja en Europa y Norteamerica. Casos clinicos. Se describen dos casos de paraparesia espastica tropical en varones naturales y residentes en Galicia. Se realizaron estudios analiticos en la sangre y el liquido cefalorraquideo (LCR), examenes neurofisiologicos y resonancia magnetica craneal y medular. En ambos pacientes, la presentacion clinica fue la de una mielopatia cronica, con cuadro torpido y progresivo que evoluciono a paraparesia espastica. Un paciente desarrollo uveitis antes de la clinica neurologica. En los dos casos, el estudio del LCR demostro leve pleocitosis linfoide, ligera hiperproteinorraquia, bandas oligoclonales negativas y anticuerpos anti-HTLV-1 positivos. La reaccion en cadena de la polimerasa para HTLV-1 resulto positiva en ambos casos. La resonancia magnetica raquidea resulto normal en un paciente y mostro en el otro hiperseñal medular dorsal, que desaparecio tras el tratamiento. No se demostraron datos de polineuropatia periferica. Recibieron corticoides e interferon alfa, con leve mejoria y estabilizacion del cuadro clinico. La anamnesis dirigida revelo antecedentes de contactos sexuales de riesgo en regiones endemicas de HTLV-1. Conclusiones. La uveitis asociada a HTLV-1 podria ser predictora de paraparesia espastica tropical. Esta es probablemente una entidad infradiagnosticada (alto porcentaje de portadores asintomaticos, clinica insidiosa y bajo indice de sospecha en areas no endemicas). Debe considerarse su diagnostico en zonas no tropicales que reciben inmigrantes de areas endemicas y tambien en regiones con una tradicional emigracion a regiones tropicales.",NA,"Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic; Spain","","Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article"

Cervical cancer treatment of HIV-positive women poses challenges. Treatment-related changes in quality of life (QOL) of such women are important to future treatment protocols. AIM: To examine demographic data of HIV-negative and HIV-positive women at diagnosis of cervical cancer and describe their changes in QOL as a result of treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: All newly diagnosed patients with cervical cancer at Tygerberg Hospital were approached to participate in the study. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Cervix Cancer Module (QLQ-CX24) were used. General QOL was measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and cervical-specific QOL with the QLQ-CX24 questionnaire. The patients completed the questionnaire at diagnosis, on completion of treatment and at 3 months' follow-up. RESULTS: The study included a total of 221 women of whom 22% were HIV-positive; the latter were younger and of higher educational level than the rest. Mean monthly income and stage distribution was similar between the two groups. HIV-positive patients underwent radiation therapy more commonly than chemoradiation. HIV-positive women showed statistically significantly higher loss to follow-up during the study. HIV-positive women experienced no improvement in insomnia, appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, social role or any of the sexual domains. In contrast, HIV-negative women experienced statistically significant improvement in all sexual domains other than sexual/vaginal functioning. The QOL improvement of HIV-negative women was statistically significantly greater than their HIV-positive counterparts in the majority of QOL domains. Global health improved in both groups, with HIV-negative women experiencing greater improvement. HIV-positive women experienced an initial decline of peripheral neuropathy (PN) symptoms post treatment with a return to pretreatment values at 3 months' follow-up. The change in PN was statistically significant between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive women. CONCLUSION: Demographic differences exist between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive groups. The differential outcome in the QOL of HIV-positive and HIV-negative women treated for cervical cancer might be related to persistence of AIDS-related symptoms on completion of cervical cancer treatment.","10.4102/sajhivmed.v16i1.368","","","Journal Article"

"26003257","Genital and sexual pain in women.","Graziottin A; Gambini D; Bertolasi L","Handbook of clinical neurology","2015","This chapter discusses the all too common problem of sex-related pain in women. Pain is a complex perceptive experience, involving biologic as well as psychologic and relational meanings. They become increasingly important with the chronicity of pain. Neurologists are quite aware of the painful aspect of many neurologic disorders, but lifelong and acquired genital and sexual pain is still neglected in a consistent percentage of women. One reason is the view - still held by many - that psychologic factors play the most important role in sex-related pain complaints. The consequences of diagnostic delay can be dramatic. Persisting tissue inflammation induces pain to change from acute and ""nociceptive,"" which indicates a ""friendly signal,"" alerting one to ongoing tissue damage, to chronic and ""neuropathic,"" a disease per se. Whilst the primary disease is progressing and neuroinflammation becomes a prominent feature, affected women have to bear years of pain and distress, huge quantifiable and non-quantifiable costs, and a progressive deterioration of personal and relational health and happiness. The scenario is even more dramatic when pain complicates an already disabling disease. The main aspects considered in this chapter include neuroinflammation as a key feature of pain; genital and sexual pain as part of neurologic diseases; and genital and sexual pain syndrome (dyspareunia and vaginismus) as primary problems, and their pelvic comorbidities (bladder pain syndrome, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, provoked vestibulodynia/vulvodynia). Finally, we discuss iatrogenic pain, i.e., genital and sexual pain caused by ill-conceived medical, surgical, pharmacologic or radiologic therapeutic interventions.","10.1016/B978-0-444-63247-0.00023-7","Female; Genital Diseases, Female; Humans; Pain; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological","Parkinson's disease; bladder pain syndrome; dyspareunia; endometriosis; iatrogenic genital pain; irritable bowel syndrome; mast cells; multiple sclerosis; neuroinflammation; peripheral neuropathies; provoked vestibulodynia/vulvodynia; sexual pain; vaginismus","Journal Article; Review"

A 29-year-old man with a 6-year history of diabetes mellitus was admitted to our hospital for poorly regulated diabetes and decreased libido. He was not an alcohol consumer. His family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed that he had a eunuchoid body shape. There was a symmetric excess fat accumulation in his submandibular, deltoid, nuchal, suprapubic and inguinal areas. He was diagnosed with Madelung's disease, and imaging studies supported the diagnosis. Hormonal evaluation revealed a hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Karyotype analysis revealed a 47,XXY mutation.

METHODS: The guidelines were developed by 26 scientific societies and two patient self-help organisations under the coordination of the Deutsche Schmerzgesellschaft (German Pain Society). A systematic literature search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline and Scopus databases (up until October 2013) was performed. Levels of evidence were assigned according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The strength of the recommendations was established by multistep formal procedures, in order to reach a consensus according to German Association of the Medical Scientific Societies (""Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlich Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften"", AWMF) regulations. The guidelines were reviewed by the Drug Commission of the German Medical Association, the Austrian Pain Society and the Swiss Association for the Study of Pain. RESULTS: Opioids are one drug-based treatment option for short- (4-12 weeks), intermediate- (13-25 weeks) and long-term (≥ 26 weeks) therapy of chronic osteoarthritis, diabetic polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia and low back pain. Contraindications are primary headaches, as well as functional somatic syndromes and mental disorders with the (cardinal) symptom pain. For all other clinical presentations, a short- and long-term therapy with opioid-containing analgesics should be evaluated on an individual basis. Long-term therapy with opioid-containing analgesics is associated with relevant risks (sexual disorders, increased mortality). CONCLUSION: Responsible application of opioid-containing analgesics requires consideration of possible indications and contraindications, as well as regular assessment of efficacy and adverse effects. Neither an uncritical increase in opioid application, nor the global rejection of opioid-containing analgesics is justified in patients with CNCP.","10.1007/s00482-014-1463-x","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Analgesics, Opioid; Chronic Pain; Consensus; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; Germany; Humans; Inappropriate Prescribing; Long-Term Care; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Young Adult","","Journal Article; Review"

METHODS: Our observational study involved a multidisciplinary surgical team that performed laparoscopy on 154 patients suffering from pelvic pain. Surgical complications occurring up to the 30th postoperative day were recorded. RESULTS: Mean age patient age was 34.1 years. Infertility was present in 69 (45%) although 31% had not attempted to get pregnant. Dysmenorrhea was the most frequent symptom (79.3%) followed by chronic pelvic pain (59.7%) and deep dyspareunia (48,7%). Most cases required extensive surgery as the majority (n=117; 76.9%) were classified as severe endometriosis (ASRM grade IV). The most frequent surgical procedures were: 136 adhesiolysis, 100 intestinal surgeries (85 retosigmoidectomies), 92 peritonal lesion excision, 39 vaginal resections, 19 myomectomies, 21 hysterectomies and 5 partial bladder resections. Postoperative complications were recorded in 14 (9.59%) patients: 8 (5.48%) major complications and 6 (4.11%) minor. Major complications included blood transfusion (n=2) retosigmoid anastomosis dehiscence (1), rectovaginal fistula (n=1), urinary fistula (n=1), deep vein thrombosis (n=1), lower limb compartment syndrome with motor deficit (n=1) and one intestinal obstruction (n=1). Minor complications were abdominal wall infection (n=3), peripheral neuropathy (n=3), bladder atony (n=1) and bladder perforation (n=1). No deaths were observed. All major complication cases underwent retosigmoidectomy associated with vaginal resection (n=6), uterosacral ligament excision (n=5) or hysterectomy (n=3). CONCLUSION: The surgical treatment of DIE is complex and subject to complications.

This study describes the long-term impact of liver surgery for CRC metastases on patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: The study used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30 and the disease-specific module, EORTC QLQ-LMC21. For functional scales, mean scores out of 100 with 95 per cent c.i. were calculated; differences of 10 points or more were considered clinically significant. Responses to symptom scales and items were categorized as 'minimal' or 'severe'. Proportions and 95 per cent c.i. for symptoms were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 241 patients were recruited; nine (3·7 per cent) had unresectable disease and were excluded. Some 68 (42 men) of 80 long-term survivors participated; their mean age was 69·5 years and median follow-up was 8·0 (range 6·9-9·2) years. Values for baseline and 1-year patient-reported outcome data were similar. Scores for functional scales were excellent (emotional function: 92, 95 per cent c.i. 87 to 96; social function: 94, 89 to 99; role function: 94, 90 to 98), reflecting clinically significant improvements from baseline values of 17 (10 to 24), 12 (3 to 21) and 12 (3 to 20) respectively. Severe symptoms were uncommon (affected less than 5 per cent of patients) for most patient-reported outcome scales or items, but persistent severe symptoms were noted for sexual function (2 per cent increase from baseline), peripheral neuropathy (2 per cent increase), constipation (10 per cent increase) and diarrhoea (5 per cent increase).

Secondary causes of RLS and the characteristics of pediatric RLS are also discussed. Finally, management strategies for RLS are summarized. METHODS: The review began with a comprehensive PubMed search for 'restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease' in combination with the following: anxiety, arthritis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, cardiac, cardiovascular disease, comorbidities, depression, end-stage renal disease, erectile dysfunction, fibromyalgia, insomnia, kidney disease, liver disease, migraine, mood disorder, multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, neuropathy, obesity, pain, Parkinson's disease, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, psychiatric disorder, sleep disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and uremia. Additional papers were identified by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved publications. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical diagnosis of RLS can be straightforward, diagnostic challenges may arise when patients present with comorbid conditions. Comorbidities of RLS include insomnia, depressive and anxiety disorders, and pain disorders. Differential diagnosis is particularly important, as some of the medications used to treat insomnia and depression may exacerbate RLS symptoms. Appropriate diagnosis and management of RLS symptoms may benefit patient well-being and, in some cases, may lessen comorbid disease burden. Therefore, it is important that physicians are aware of the presence of RLS when treating patients with conditions that commonly co-occur with the disorder.","10.1185/03007995.2014.918029","Combined Modality Therapy; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Management; Humans; Restless Legs Syndrome","Comorbidities; Depression; End-stage renal disease; Insomnia; Pain; Pregnancy; Restless legs syndrome","Journal Article; Review"

MATERIAL/METHODS: retrospective study (january 1990-january 2009) who analyzed data from patients hospitalized in the Regional Center Craiova. We have compared 26 patients (group N) diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy  with 40 patients (group C) without neuropsychological sufferings, randomly selected. We have analysed: age, height, HIV mode of transmission, AIDS status, the average and nadir of CD4 lymphocytes, the mean viral load, the average duration of antiretroviral treatment (ART), use and duration of use of d-drugs, the presence of certain coinfection, diabetes or ethanol abuse. RESULTS: the following differences were statistically significant: age (31,54±14,64 vs 23,9±12,03 years, p=0.024), HIV mode of transmission  (parenteral/sexual: 13/13 vs 28/8, p = 0.044), the monitoring time duration (5,31±3,77 vs 7,75±5,4 years, p=0.043), median ART duration (37,2±9,66 vs 45,12±8,75 months, p=0.001). Close to the threshold of statistical significance are the CD4 nadir (97,33±65,6 vs 123,15±43,35 cells/mm3, p=0.058) and duration of use of d-drugs (22,5±31,94 vs 12,24±8,6 months, p=0.057). Odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) increase with age. ROC analysis for the study group establishes a threshold difference of 29 years (sensitivity 50%, specificity 80%). CONCLUSIONS: higher age and advanced immunosupression are the most important risk factors for developing symptomatic peripheral neuropathy in Romanian HIV infected patients; taking into account the small number of cases studied, although not statistically significant, it should be noted the CD4 nadir and the length of d-drug use.","10.12865/CHSJ.40.01.07","","HIV; peripheral neuropathy; risk factors","Journal Article"

These patients develop clinically significant ED and comprise a significant portion of the patient group which do not respond to PDE-5 inhibitors. Testosterone has been shown to increase the expression of PDE-5. This function of testosterone supports its effect on the regulation of erection and increasing the sexual libido. In view of the complexity of ED, as well as the effect of testosterone on erection, it is concluded that PDE-5 inhibitors in combination with testosterone replacement would be a better therapy alternative in the management of erectile dysfunction in hypogonadal patients.","10.5812/numonthly.11523","","Erectile Dysfunction; Testosterone; Therapeutics","Journal Article; Review"

Unlike other current treatment options for ED, all of which are palliative in nature, LI-ESWT is unique in that it aims to restore the erectile mechanism in order to enable natural or spontaneous erections. Results from basic science experiments have provided evidence that LI-ESWT induces cellular microtrauma, which in turn stimulates the release of angiogenic factors and the subsequent neovascularization of the treated tissue. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been clinically investigated and applied in several medical fields with various degrees of success. High-intensity shock wave therapy is used for lithotripsy because of its focused mechanical destructive nature, and medium-intensity shock waves have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and are used for treating a wide array of orthopedic conditions, such as non-union fractures, tendonitis, and bursitis. In contrast, LI-ESWT has angiogenetic properties and is therefore used in the management of chronic wounds, peripheral neuropathy, and in cardiac neovascularization. As a result of these characteristics we initiated a series of experiments evaluating the effect of LI-ESWT on the cavernosal tissue of patients with vasculogenic ED. The results of our studies, which also included a double-blind randomized control trial, confirm that LI-ESWT generates a significant clinical improvement of erectile function and a significant improvement in penile hemodynamics without any adverse effects. Although further extensive research is needed, LI-ESWT may create a new standard of care for men with vasculogenic ED.","10.1177/1756287212470696","","erectile dysfunction; male impotence; shockwaves; therapy","Journal Article"

Here we aimed to enlarge the spectrum of SACS mutations outside Quebec, to establish the pathogenicity of novel variants, and to expand the clinical and imaging phenotype. METHODS: Sequencing of SACS in 22 patients with unexplained early-onset ataxia, assessment of novel SACS variants in 3.500 European control chromosomes and extensive phenotypic investigations of all SACS carriers. RESULTS: We identified 11 index patients harbouring 17 novel SACS variants. 9/11 patients harboured two variants of at least probable pathogenicity which were not observed in controls and, in case of missense mutations, were located in highly conserved domains. These 9 patients accounted for at least 11% (9/83) in our series of unexplained early onset ataxia subjects. While most patients (7/9) showed the classical ARSACS triad, the presenting phenotype reached from pure neuropathy (leading to the initial diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) in one subject to the absence of any signs of neuropathy in another. In contrast to its name ""spastic ataxia"", neither spasticity (absent in 2/9=22%) nor extensor plantar response (absent in 3/9=33%) nor cerebellar ataxia (absent in 1/9=11%) were obligate features. Autonomic features included urine urge incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Apart from the well-established MRI finding of pontine hypointensities, all patients (100%) showed hyperintensities of the lateral pons merging into the (thickened) middle cerebellar peduncles. In addition, 63% exhibited bilateral parietal cerebral atrophy, and 63% a short circumscribed thinning of the posterior midbody of the corpus callosum. In 2 further patients with differences in important clinical features, VUS class 3 variants (c.1373C>T [p.Thr458Ile] and c.2983 G>T [p.Val995Phe]) were identified. These variants were, however, also observed in controls, thus questioning their pathogenic relevance. CONCLUSIONS: We here demonstrate that each feature of the classical ARSACS triad (cerebellar ataxia, spasticity and peripheral neuropathy) might be missing in ARSACS. Nevertheless, characteristic MRI features - which also extend to supratentorial regions and involve the cerebral cortex - will help to establish the diagnosis in most cases.","10.1186/1750-1172-8-41","Genes, Recessive; Humans; Muscle Spasticity; Mutation, Missense; Phenotype; Spinocerebellar Ataxias","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

At baseline, all QLQ-C30 scales and symptoms were significantly worse than age-adjusted values for the general population. Subsequently QoL improved in general. During chemotherapy with paclitaxel, most functioning scales and symptoms worsened slightly (not significantly). However, peripheral neuropathy and chemotherapy-related side-effects increased to clinically important levels. At the end of treatment, most QoL scores were similar to those of the general population, but physical functioning and fatigue were worse.

Considering that most patients are young and sexually active at the moment of diagnosis and the long life expectancy of survivors after the treatment, quality of life (QoL) and sexual function are important issues for cancer survivors and caregivers. However, only a few studies have examined the QoL and sexual function in disease-free cervical cancer survivors, and there are no studies in the literature comparing prospectively sexual function after different types of radical hysterectomy. AIM: To compare sexual function in two groups of early stage cervical cancer survivors treated by radical surgery alone, undergoing two different types of radical hysterectomy. METHODS: Patients treated by radical hysterectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy for early stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2-IB1) have been enrolled and divided in two groups with regard to type of radical hysterectomy performed; S1: modified radical hysterectomy (Piver II/Type B), S2: classic radical hysterectomy (Piver III/ Type C2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Twenty-four months after surgery we assessed the sexual function using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Cervix Cancer Module Questionnaire, which is a validated system for the assessment of disease- and treatment-specific issues that affect the QoL and sexual functioning of women who are treated for cervical cancer. RESULTS: Of the 31 patients enrolled in the S1 group and 46 in the S2 group, 23 and 33 patients have been included, respectively. We observed significant differences between the two groups in terms of symptom experience, sexual/vaginal functioning, sexual activity, and sexual enjoyment. There was not any significant difference regarding lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, and sexual worry. CONCLUSION: Survivors of early stage cervical cancer treated by modified radical hysterectomy (Piver II/ Type B) have a better sexual function than those operated by classic radical hysterectomy (Piver III/ Type C2).","10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02581.x","Adult; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","","Comparative Study; Journal Article"

The disease is most commonly caused by a point mutation within the TTR gene inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Over 100 of such mutations have been identified, leading to destabilization of the physiological TTR tetramer. As a result, many monomers originate with a tendency for spontaneous conformational changes and self-aggregation. The main clinical feature of TTR-FAP is progressive sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. In the beginning, this polyneuropathy predominantly involves small unmyelinated nerve fibers with the result of dissociated sensory loss disproportionately affecting sensation of pain and temperature. Autonomic neuropathy typically accompanies sensory deficits early in the disease course. The symptoms include orthostatic hypotension, constipation alternating with diarrhea, erectile dysfunction, anhydrosis, and urinary retention or incontinence. Later, involvement of motor fibers causes rapidly progressive weakness and gait disturbances. In addition to the peripheral nervous system, the heart and the gut are frequently affected. Onset of symptoms is bimodal, with one peak at age 33 years (early onset) and another distinct peak in the sixth decade of life (late onset). The course of TTR-FAP is uniformly progressive and fatal. Death occurs an average of 10.8 years after the onset of symptoms in Portuguese patients, and 7.3 years in late-onset Japanese patients. Common causes include cachexia, cardiac failure, arrhythmia, and secondary infections. Liver transplantation is the standard therapy for patients who are in a clinical condition good enough to tolerate this intervention because it stops progression of neuropathy by removing the main source of mutant TTR. Recently, orally administered tafamidis meglumine has been approved by European authorities for treatment of FAP. The substance has been shown to stabilize the TTR tetramer, thereby improving the outcome of patients with TTR-FAP. Various other strategies have been studied in vitro to prevent TTR amyloidosis, including gene therapy, immunization, dissolution of TTR aggregates, and free radical scavengers, but none of them is ready for clinical use so far.","10.2147/TACG.S19903","","FAP; amyloidosis; therapy; transthyretin; treatment","Journal Article"

METHODS: Women attending follow-up clinic at Hammersmith Hospital having undergone treatment for primary or relapsed ovarian cancer were asked to complete two validated questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OV28) and a ""wellbeing thermometer"". Results were assessed and stratified by patient age, tumour stage, relapse status, type of chemotherapy received and treatment-free interval. Symptoms reported in questionnaires were compared to those documented in patients' hospital notes. RESULTS: Of 116 women approached, 100 (86%) participated in this study and had received chemotherapy for ovarian cancer between 2003 and 2010. The most frequently described and severe symptoms reported in the questionnaires were emotional symptoms, negative feelings about treatment or prognosis, fatigue and pain. Dyspareunia, cognitive impairment and peripheral neuropathy were also frequently described. Symptom severity was independent of variables such as disease stage, type of chemotherapy received and relapse status. The ""wellbeing thermometer"" scores closely correlated with pain, fatigue, weakness, gastrointestinal symptoms and attitude to disease or treatment (p<0.001). There was a marked discordance between questionnaire-reported symptoms and those recorded in hospital notes. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women surveyed experienced persistent psychological and physical symptoms following ovarian cancer treatment; in particular: psychological concerns, sexual inactivity and fatigue, all potentially reversible with appropriate interventions.

Patient reported outcomes are essential in capturing patients' experiences in order to address survivorship issues; however, patient reported toxicities are not often collected or reported. METHODS: A web-based survivorship care plan tool was used to collect patient reported toxicity data for 390 women who had undergone treatment for gynecological cancer. Demographic, diagnosis, treatment modality and toxicity data were reviewed. RESULTS: Median age of diagnosis was 49 years, and 88% (n=334) of the women were Caucasian and had attended at least some college. Only 10% (n=38) had previously been offered a survivorship care plan or survivorship information. Almost half of the patients had ovarian cancer (46%, n=180), 23% had cervical cancer (n=92) and 28% had uterine cancer (n=109). Late effects most commonly reported for all gynecological malignancy survivors using this tool were cognitive changes, sexual side effects, changes in bowel patterns, peripheral neuropathy and skin changes. CONCLUSION: Women with gynecological cancers experience a plethora of late effects; however, very few of them have access to a survivorship plan to cope with these issues. Patient reported side effects, especially sexual dysfunction, occur more commonly than previously reported. Patient-focused tools to evaluate these side effects and access to survivorship plans are needed for comprehensive care of gynecologic cancer survivors.","10.1016/j.ygyno.2011.11.034","Adolescent; Adult; Aftercare; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Social Class; Survivors; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

METHODS: A systematic literature review process was used. This focused on published reviews to enable a fast but rigorous identification of both the gaps and well-researched areas within survivorship. RESULTS: The search identified 5121 reviews, of which 42 were screened and 9 met the quality and inclusion criteria. The majority of papers focused on physical well being (n = 6) with the remaining papers focusing on practical well being (employment and finance). The quality of the reviews varied (ranging from weak to good). Gaps identified include sexual function, lower-limb lymphoedema, peripheral neuropathy, bladder and GI problems, hormonal sequelae, older cancer survivors, work impact of cancer and context-specific unmet supportive care needs. The review found a lack of standardised nomenclature for survivorship and methodological limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Four main gaps in knowledge relating to the practical and physical problems associated with cancer survivorship have been identified. These are key symptoms, unmet supportive care needs, employment and older cancer survivors, and should be addressed by future research and systematic literature reviews. Work is also needed to address the nomenclature of survivorship and to improve the methodology of research into cancer survivors (including standardised measures, theoretical frameworks, longitudinal design, inclusion of older survivors and age-matched controls for comparison).

Nevertheless, only a few studies have examined the QoL and sexual function in disease-free cervical cancer survivors. AIM: The objective of this study is to evaluate the sexual function in a cervical cancer patient's group treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) plus type C2/type III radical hysterectomy (RH). METHODS: We have enrolled in the oncologic group (OG) sexually active patients affected by cervical cancer (stage IB2 to IIIB) treated with NACT followed by RH. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Included subjects were interviewed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CX24 Questionnaire. Two consecutive assessments were recorded: at the first evaluation postoperatively (T1) and at the 12-month follow-up visit (T2). Results were compared with a benign gynecological disease group (BG) and with a healthy control group (HG). RESULTS: A total of 33 patients for OG, 37 for BG, and 35 women for HG were recruited. After surgery, sexual activity has been resumed by 76% of the OG patients and 83.7% of the BG patients (P = not significant). Cancer survivors had clinically worse problems with symptom experience, body image, and sexual/vaginal functioning than controls (P < 0.05). OG patients also reported more severe lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, menopausal symptoms, and sexual worry. For sexual activity, the score difference between cancer survivors and women with benign gynecological disease is not statically significant. Concerning sexual enjoyment assessment, our study shows comparable results for OG and BG. CONCLUSION: Nevertheless, the worsening of symptom experience, body image, and sexual/vaginal functioning, OG patients have same sexual activity and sexual enjoyment data compared with those of BG patients.

To investigate functional genomic consequences of these differences, we compared their physiological levels of phytanic acid, a branched chain fatty acid that can be derived from the microbial degradation of chlorophyll in ruminant guts. Humans who accumulate large stores of phytanic acid commonly develop cerebellar ataxia, peripheral polyneuropathy, and retinitis pigmentosa in addition to other medical conditions. Furthermore, phytanic acid is an activator of the PPAR-alpha transcription factor that influences the expression of genes relevant to lipid metabolism. RESULTS: Despite their trace dietary phytanic acid intake, all great ape species had elevated red blood cell (RBC) phytanic acid levels relative to humans on diverse diets. Unlike humans, chimpanzees showed sexual dimorphism in RBC phytanic acid levels, which were higher in males relative to females. Cultured skin fibroblasts from all species had a robust capacity to degrade phytanic acid. We provide indirect evidence that great apes, in contrast to humans, derive significant amounts of phytanic acid from the hindgut fermentation of plant materials. This would represent a novel reduction of metabolic activity in humans relative to the great apes. CONCLUSION: We identified differences in the physiological levels of phytanic acid in humans and great apes and propose this is causally related to their gut anatomies and microbiomes. Phytanic acid levels could contribute to cross-species and sex-specific differences in human and great ape transcriptomes, especially those related to lipid metabolism. Based on the medical conditions caused by phytanic acid accumulation, we suggest that differences in phytanic acid metabolism could influence the functions of human and great ape nervous, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems.","10.1186/1472-6793-10-19","Animals; Erythrocytes; Female; Gene Expression; Gorilla gorilla; Hominidae; Humans; Intestines; Male; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Phytanic Acid; Pongo pygmaeus","","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

Our aim was to develop a conceptual framework of PROs for hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) to support measurement clarity. METHODS: Relevant outcome issues were identified from review of recent clinical trials. This provided content for an interview with 15 metastatic HRPC patients and a survey of 10 practitioners. All participants were asked about the relevance and importance of 26 outcomes and were allowed to nominate new outcomes. Practitioners were also asked to determine which outcomes endorsed by patients were attributable to the disease (symptoms) versus treatment (side effects). Analyses of archived clinical trial data were used to verify and augment the interview and survey results. RESULTS: Patients endorsed 11 concerns as relevant and important to HRPC including general pain, bone pain, urinary problems, fatigue, appetite loss, constipation, erectile dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, PSA anxiety, and changes in self image. Practitioner judgments helped classify each concern into one of four categories, disease symptom, treatment side effect, both symptom and side effect, or psychological concern. Additionally, patients endorsed (and practitioners confirmed) the relevance and importance of several general domains of quality of life. Analyses of archived data confirmed the importance of these issues and suggested two additional concerns. CONCLUSION: Findings were used to propose a conceptual framework of PROs for metastatic HRPC. Such frameworks can be used to help specify targets for assessment in clinical studies such as treatment trials.","10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00702.x","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Anxiety; Area Under Curve; Confidence Intervals; Data Collection; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Mitoxantrone; Neoplasm Metastasis; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pain Measurement; Prednisone; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Self Concept","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Primary care continues to be predominantly delivered by high caseload general practitioners and specialists, but GPs with limited HIV experience are increasingly likely to have contact with HIV positive patients through shared care arrangements. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to review the management of stable patients with HIV and to provide an approach to important elements of their ongoing care. DISCUSSION: The long term care of people living with HIV is increasingly focused on chronic disease management and health promotion. Specific issues include mental health; drug and alcohol use; sexual and reproductive health; cardiovascular, renal, liver and bone disease; malignancies; and prevention, including immunisation. Treatment side effects such as lipodystrophy and peripheral neuropathy are less common with newer agents, but other toxicities are increasingly recognised. The majority of people living with HIV can be managed in the general practice setting, with specialist support where appropriate.",NA,"Anti-Retroviral Agents; Australia; Disease Management; HIV Infections; HIV Long-Term Survivors; Humans","","Journal Article"

Most human autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS) and autoimmune thyroid disease, have an increased incidence and prevalence in females, but a few others such as autoimmune diabetes, the Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) and psoriasis are increased in males. Animal models of autoimmunity show an equivalent sexual dimorphism. The possible reasons for the differing incidence and prevalence of autoimmune diseases in females and males engage our attention. Environmental exposures may differ for females and males. There are innate differences in the function of the female and male immune systems, and there is some evidence for differences between females and males in the ability of a target organ for autoimmunity to withstand damage. In seeking reasons for these differences, we review the role of sex hormones in immunity and include results of trials of hormone therapy in autoimmune diseases. The association of autoimmunity and pregnancy, a female-specific condition, is discussed, and the claimed effects of lymphoid cell microchimerism on provocation of autoimmunity are reviewed. Genetic predisposition is an important factor in autoimmune disease and we particularly focus on genes on the X and Y chromosomes, the role of X chromosome inactivation, and the interaction of the sex of the patient with other genetic factors. The possible role of epigenetic mechanisms, including environmental influences, is then surveyed. We assert that sex is a vital variable that must be considered in all immunological studies, as it should be at all levels of biological research.","10.2174/156652409789839116","Autoimmune Diseases; Female; Humans; Male; Sex Characteristics","","Journal Article; Review"

Associations between neuroticism and morbidity in long-term cancer survivors have hardly been explored. The aim of this study was to explore associations between neuroticism and somatic and mental morbidity and lifestyle issues in long-term survivors of testicular cancer (TCSs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: All Norwegian TCSs treated between 1980 and 1994 (n = 1 814) were invited to this cross-sectional study. Among them 1 428 (79% response rate) delivered valid data. Neuroticism was self-rated on an abridged version of the Eysenck Personality Inventory. Information was collected by mailed questionnaires. The associations of neuroticism and self-reported variables were tested with multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Neuroticism was significantly associated with presence of somatic complaints, reduced physical function, neurotoxic side-effects (tinnitus, hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and Raynaud's Phenomenon), self-esteem, concerns about not being able to father children, sexual problems, hazardous alcohol use, daily use of medication, use of sedatives and hypnotics, recent visits to a general practitioner, and seeing a psychologist/ psychiatrist after ended cancer treatment. Poor self-rated health, higher number of negative life events, economical problems and problems getting loans granted showed significant associations with neuroticism. DISCUSSION: Neuroticism in TCSs at long-term follow-up is significantly associated with somatic and mental morbidities, and several aspects of unhealthy lifestyle. High levels of neuroticism should be considered in TCSs expressing multiple complaints and concerns at follow-up consultations. Assessment of neuroticism may be clinically important in order to offer appropriate interventions to prevent and manage morbidity in TCSs.","10.1080/02841860902795232","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Neurotic Disorders; Norway; Personality Inventory; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Self Concept; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survival Rate; Survivors; Testicular Neoplasms; Time Factors; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

Increasing awareness, particularly through the media, is inducing more men to seek help for this condition. Erectile dysfunction is defined as the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection adequate for satisfactory sexual activity. The prevalence increases with age. Basic and clinical research is identifying the neurovascular and humoral control of the mechanisms. The initial evaluation should differentiate erectile dysfunction from premature ejaculation and loss of libido. Myocardial insufficiency, hypogonadism and peripheral neuropathy should be looked for. Initial laboratory investigations should be restricted to identifying previously undetected medical illness that may directly contribute to erectile dysfunction. Discussing the available options with the couple is an important aspect. If erectile dysfunction is secondary to other treatable disorders these should be treated simultaneously. When other diseases that require intervention are ruled out and if there are no contraindications, therapy may be initiated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In selected cases, psychosexual therapy may be beneficial. If phosphodiesterase inhibitors are contraindicated, vacuum constriction devices may be tried. Further options include intracavemosal injection, intraurethral instillation, penile revascularization and prosthesis. The availability of effective and well-tolerated oral medications has dramatically changed the clinical approach to erectile dysfunction. Pharmacotherapy is the preferred cost-effective first-line therapy in the vast majority of patients. A stepped-care approach is followed in the primary care and family practice settings.

In addition, much controversy surrounds the differences in manifestations of SLE in both sexes. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the possible etiologies of the greater prevalence of SLE in females, as well as the differences in the clinical presentation of the disease in both sexes. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through a PubMed search for articles published between 1960 and 2001; no language restrictions were applied. Search terms included lupus, SLE, and gender differences. Books and online resources were also consulted. RESULTS: Potential causes of the female predilection for SLE included the effects of estrogen and its hydroxylation, decreased androgen levels, hyperprolactinemia, and differences in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling. Clinical manifestations of SLE included females having more frequent relapses, but the incidence of severe relapses was the same in both sexes. Raynaud phenomenon, arthritis, and leukopenia were more common in women, whereas skin manifestations, serositis, and renal involvement were more common in men. For neurologic manifestations, females with SLE experienced more psychiatric symptoms and headaches, whereas males with SLE experienced more seizures and peripheral neuropathy. Males with SLE also tended to have more severe renal disease and cardiorespiratory involvement. CONCLUSIONS: The increased frequency of SLE among women may be attributed to differences in the metabolism of sex hormones and/or GnRH. Though less common in men, when it does occur SLE tends to run a more severe course-an important consideration in the diagnosis and follow-up of male patients with SLE.","10.1016/s1550-8579(04)80006-8","Female; Hormones; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Sex Factors","","Journal Article; Review"

Because of the high incidence of intolerable side effects observed with protease inhibitor- and zidovudine-based NPEP regimens, our unit changed standard NPEP treatment to 28 days of tenofovir-lamivudine-stavudine (TDF-3TC-d4T). The aim of this study was to compare side effects and numbers of individuals completing NPEP before and after this change. METHODS: Parameters were compared amongst individuals commencing the following NPEP regimens: zidovudine-lamivudine (ZDV-3TC), zidovudine-lamivudine-nelfinavir (ZDV-3TC-NFV) and TDF-3TC-d4T. RESULTS: A total of 385 individuals received ZDV-3TC (n = 36), ZDV-3TC-NFV (n = 225) or TDF-3TC-d4T (n = 137) as NPEP for the first time between June 1999 and November 2003. Noncompletion rates were 25%, 32% and 15%, respectively (P = 0.001), with odds ratios for noncompletion being 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-4.8] and 2.7 (95% CI 1.6-4.8) in the first two groups compared with the TDF-3TC-d4T group (P = 0.008). Adverse events were less common in the TDF-3TC-d4T group, with significantly lower rates of nausea and headache, but significantly higher rates of peripheral neuropathy and asymptomatic raised transaminases.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were 1,408 TCSs treated between 1980 and 1994 in Norway. Participants provided information about their medical, social, and familial situation on a questionnaire. They also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Anxiety disorder and depression were defined by a score >/= 8 on the HADS subscales. The prevalence rates were compared with age-adjusted norm data. RESULTS: HADS-defined anxiety disorder was more prevalent in TCSs (19.2%; 95% CI, 17.2% to 21.3%) than in the norm sample (13.5%; 95% CI, 13.1% to 13.9%; P < .001), whereas the prevalence of HADS-defined depression did not differ from the norm (TCSs, 9.7%; 95% CI, 8.1% to 11.2% v norm, 10.1%, 95% CI, 9.5 to 10.5; P = .56). The relative risk for anxiety disorder was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.31 to 1.69) and for depression the relative risk was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.14) in TCSs compared with norm. In multivariate analyses, HADS-defined anxiety disorder in TCSs was associated with young age, peripheral neuropathy, economic problems, alcohol problems, sexual problems, relapse anxiety, and having been treated for mental problems. CONCLUSION: Long-term TCSs have an increased risk of HADS-defined anxiety disorder that warrants clinical attention. Checking easily available demographic and TC-related data and use of a simple screening test such as HADS assists the identification of TCSs with anxiety disorder.","10.1200/JCO.2005.05.061","Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Depression; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Survivors; Testicular Neoplasms","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Given the gains in survival time, patient care is being expanded to include enhancement or preservation of QOL in addition to early diagnosis and disease treatment, thus treating the whole person. In parallel with this evolution in cancer care, supportive measures are being increasingly recognized as crucial to effective patient management. This paper reviews some of the potential causes of diminished QOL in gynecologic cancer patients and basic treatment strategies for their control, with a focus on short-term QOL issues.

"11851201","Bariatric surgery for severe obesity.","Sugerman HJ","Journal of the Association for Academic Minority Physicians : the official publication of the Association for Academic Minority Physicians","2001","Severe obesity is associated with multiple comorbidities and is refractory to dietary management with or without behavioral or drug therapies. There are a number of surgical procedures for the treatment of morbid obesity, including purely gastric restrictive, a combination of malabsorption and gastric restriction or primary malabsorption. The purely gastric restrictive procedures, including vertical banded gastroplasty and laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding, do not provide adequate weight loss. African-American patients do especially poorly after the banding procedure with the loss of only 11% of excess weight in one study. Gastric bypass (GBP) is associated with the loss of 66% of excess weight at 1 to 2 years after surgery, 60% at 5 years and 50% at 10 years. For unknown reasons, African-American patients lose significantly less weight than Caucasians after GBP. There is a risk of micronutrient deficiencies after GBP, including iron deficiency anemia in menstruating women, vitamin B12, and calcium deficiencies. Prophylactic supplementation of these nutrients is necessary. Recurrent vomiting after bariatric surgery may be associated with a severe polyneuropathy and must be aggressively treated with endoscopic dilatation before this complication is allowed to develop. The malabsorptive procedures include the partial biliopancreatic bypass (BPD) and BPD with duodenal switch (BPD/DS). The BPD appears to cause severe protein-calorie malnutrition in American patients; the BPD/DS may be associated with less malnutrition. Weight loss failure after GBP does not respond to tightening a dilated gastrojejunal stoma or reducing the size of the gastric pouch. These patients may require conversion to a malabsorptive distal GBP, similar to the BPD. However, because of the risk of severe protein-calorie malnutrition and calcium deficiency BPD should be reserved for patients with severe obesity comorbidity. The risk of death following bariatric surgery is between 1% and 2% in most series but is significantly higher in patients with respiratory insufficiency of obesity. In most patients, surgically induced weight loss will correct hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, venous stasis disease, urinary incontinence, female sexual hormone dysfunction, pseudotumor cerebri, degenerative joint disease pains, as well as improved self-image and employability.",NA,"Adult; Biliopancreatic Diversion; Black People; Female; Gastric Bypass; Gastroplasty; Humans; Jejunoileal Bypass; Male; Obesity, Morbid; Postoperative Complications; Weight Loss; Black or African American","","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Review"

The study investigated the relationship of alcohol-related medical disorders in alcoholics and their drinking pattern. Two hundred and forty-one chronic alcoholics were referred consecutively for detoxification and their drinking pattern was sufficient for them to be included in this study. History of alcohol abuse as well as drinking behaviour in the last 6 months were assessed by a semi-structured interview. Findings included intensive clinical examination with abdominal ultrasound in most subjects. Heavy drinking with frequent inebriation was most often found in our sample (44.4%), whereas continuous heavy alcohol consumption without intoxication (33.6%), and an episodic drinking style (22.0%) were less frequent. The heavy drinkers suffered more often from pancreatitis, oesophageal varices, polyneuropathy or erectile dysfunction than episodic drinkers. They also showed more upper gastrointestinal disorders, although the estimated life-time alcohol intake was comparable to continuous drinkers. No difference relating to withdrawal delirium or seizures could be found between the groups of alcoholics. Frequent heavy drinkers showed a trend to more alcohol-related medical disorders than alcoholics with a different drinking pattern, although they were younger and their estimated life-time alcohol intake was comparable to that of continuous drinkers. Thus, the drinking pattern, particularly frequent inebriation, has an influence on the occurrence of alcohol-related disorders.","10.1093/alcalc/34.3.330","Adult; Alcoholism; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Health Status; Humans; Liver Diseases; Male; Nervous System Diseases; Pancreatitis; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Wounds and Injuries","","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

When used correctly, VEDs carry low morbidity and few recognized complications. We report on 5 patients who developed unusual complications associated with VED use, including two previously unreported complications of urethral bleeding and capture of scrotal tunica within the penile shaft. METHODS: Patient 1: a 38-year-old diabetic man with significant peripheral neuropathy and an 8-year history of erectile dysfunction developed penile skin necrosis at the ring site after leaving the penile ring on for an excessive length of time (6 hours). Patient 2: a 76-year-old diabetic man who used a VED correctly for 3 months developed severe urethral bleeding. Patient 3: a 75-year-old diabetic man who enjoyed satisfactory erections with a VED for 14 months developed a 3 x 3-cm penile cystic mass located on the proximal right side of the penile shaft. This mass was not present in the flaccid state and was seen only with VED use. Patient 4: a 65-year-old man developed Peyronie's disease after 4 years of correct VED use. Patient 5: a 62-year-old man with neurogenic impotence following a radical prostatectomy developed penile ecchymoses acutely following placement of a smaller constriction ring. He subsequently developed a dorsal penile plaque with mild dorsal curvature. RESULTS: Patient 1 did well with local skin care and no longer uses a VED. Patient 2 underwent cystoscopy and was found to have prominent urethral vessels (varicosities) in the midurethra, compared with a normal cystoscopy 9 months previously. This patient no longer uses a VED and now denies any urethral bleeding at 15-month follow-up. Patient 3 underwent corpora cavernosography and contrast injection of the cystic mass. These radiographic studies showed that the mass did not communicate with either corpora cavernosa or the corpus spongiosum. A retrograde urethrogram failed to show a urethral diverticulum. The patient was surgically explored, and the penile cystic mass was found to be scrotal tunica vaginalis. Subsequently, a hydrocele repair was performed, yet postoperatively the patient developed testicular migration into the ipsilateral penile shaft. Testicular fixation was not feasible secondary to a childhood herniorrhaphy, and an orchiectomy was performed. Patient 4 underwent implantation of a penile prosthesis and is doing well at 3-year follow-up. Patient 5 experiences mild dorsal penile curvature with erections induced by transurethral prostaglandin E1. The penile curvature does not interfere with intercourse and will be managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS: We describe unusual side effects associated with VEDs. Although thousands of men use VEDs successfully and without morbidity, the urologist must be aware of unusual complications associated with VED use.","10.1016/s0090-4295(97)00706-1","Adult; Aged; Equipment and Supplies; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Penile Diseases; Vacuum","","Journal Article; Review"

Thalidomide was first developed and marketed in Germany in the 1950s as a sedative. It was withdrawn in 1962 when it was recognized to cause birth defects. Possessing no antibacterial activity, thalidomide is now used to treat a variety of diseases with an autoimmune character. It is unclear how it works to modulate the immune system or whether or not it will accelerate the deterioration of the immunological status of HIV-positive patients. One study suggests that it may suppress HIV viral replication and decrease viral burden. Thalidomide inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF). It affects the nervous system, often causing side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, decreased libido and mood changes, as well as peripheral neuropathy. However, most of the neuropathy cases occurred in patients who had received a high dose for longer than six months. Response to thalidomide occurs at doses ranging from 100mg a day to 400 mg a day, with ulcer pain resolving within two to four days. Randomized placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of thalidomide in HIV-positive persons with aphthous ulcers.

The preferential target of HIV infection is the lymphocyte that expresses the CD4 phenotype. Infection of CD4 subsets leads to a remarkable cytopathic effect that can be blocked by antibodies anti CD4 epitope. Actually the HIV envelope proteins recognize an epitope of the CD4 surface molecules; as consequence the antibodies anti idiotypic directed to CD4 indirectly present the binding of envelope proteins to CD4. The relationship between this retrovirus and the immunological pathogenesis of the disease are also discussed. HIV infection is facilitated in groups affected by alterations of the immune system as drug abusers, haemophiliacs and homosexuals. Secondary immunological abnormalities are consistently pronounced in people seropositive for the virus and affected by a progressive generalized lymphoadenopathy (PGL). The degeneration of primary lymphatic organs causes a reduction of the T-cell response against any antigenic challenge. After the PGL phase the disease shifts on AIDS, that is an irreversible stadium accompanied by the deterioration of the clinical status and by an increase of immunosuppression that favours the arise of tumours. In addiction HIV infection may cause severe central nervous system (CNS) dysfunctions, the HIV associated neurological syndromes include myelopathy, meningitis, encephalitis and peripheral neuropathy.

During this period, computer tomography, determination of serum AFP/HCG, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy represented the modern diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Before orchiectomy 67% of the patients had elevated AFP/HCG. An abnormal postorchiectomy serum tumour marker decrease and the presence of small vessel infiltration in the histological sections of the primary tumour significantly predicted microscopic retroperitoneal metastases in patients with clinical stage I (CSI) nonseminoma. One-third of these patients had a pathological stage II (PSII). After radiotherapy 99% of 90 seminoma patients (CSI/IIa) survived for 5 years. After cisplatin-based chemotherapy (+radiotherapy/surgery) the 5-year survival rate in 25 patients with advanced seminoma was 81%. The survival rate in 148 nonseminoma patients PSI/IIa was 100% and 87% in 94 patients with advanced nonseminoma (greater than or equal to CSIIb).

In 15 patients with spinal injuries, although the aetiology was predominantly neurological, six exhibited poor flow in the deep penile arteries following injection of papaverine.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature reporting such pulmonary lesions in ATTRm amyloidosis, and notably diagnosed through cryobiopsy. A 51-year-old man from Mali with a past medical history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome presented erectile dysfunction, asthenia and worsening dyspnoea over the past year. He presented signs of cardiac failure; histological and radiological investigations diagnosed cardiac amyloidosis. He was found homozygote for the V122I mutation in transthyretin. A diffuse cystic lung disease (DCLD) was noted on computed tomography (CT) scan. We performed a transbronchial pulmonary cryobiopsy that revealed histological transthyretin amyloid deposits. This case report illustrates the safety and usefulness of cryobiopsy in the setting of DCLD and extends ATTRm amyloidosis as a possible cause of DCLD.","10.1177/17534666231178690","Male; Humans; Middle Aged; Prealbumin; Amyloidosis; Mutation; Heart Failure; Lung Diseases","Val122Ile ATTRm amyloidosis; diffuse cystic lung disease; hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis; pulmonary cryobiopsy","Case Reports; Journal Article"

We followed 4.4 million Danes, including 9,615 same-sex married (SSM) persons, for 47 autoimmune diseases in the National Patient Registry between 1989 and 2008. Poisson regression analyses provided first hospitalization rate ratios (RRs) comparing rates between SSM individuals and persons in other marital status categories. SSM individuals experienced no unusual overall risk of autoimmune diseases. However, the risk of autoimmune thyroid dysfunction was increased, notably Hashimoto's thyroiditis (women(SSM), RR = 2.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74-4.55) and Graves' disease (men(SSM), RR = 1.88; 95% CI 1.08-3.01). There was also an excess of primary biliary cirrhosis (women(SSM), RR = 4.09; 95% CI 1.01-10.7), and of psoriasis (men(SSM), RR = 2.48; 95% CI 1.77-3.36), rheumatic fever (men(SSM), RR = 7.55; 95% CI 1.87-19.8), myasthenia gravis (men(SSM), RR = 5.51; 95% CI 1.36-14.4), localized scleroderma (men(SSM), RR = 7.16; 95% CI 1.18-22.6) and pemphigoid (men(SSM), RR = 6.56; 95% CI 1.08-20.6), while Dupuytren's contracture was reduced (men(SSM), RR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.39-0.99). The excess of psoriasis was restricted to same-sex married men with HIV/AIDS (men(SSM), RR = 10.5; 95% CI 6.44-15.9), whereas Graves' disease occurred in excess only among same-sex married men without HIV/AIDS (men(SSM), RR = 1.99; 95% CI 1.12-3.22). Lesbians and immunologically competent gay men in same-sex marriage face no unusual overall risk of autoimmune diseases. However, the observed increased risk of thyroid dysfunction in these lesbians and gay men deserves further study.","10.1007/s10654-013-9869-9","Adolescent; Adult; Autoimmune Diseases; Cohort Studies; Confidence Intervals; Denmark; Female; Graves Disease; Homosexuality; Humans; Male; Marital Status; Marriage; Registries; Regression Analysis; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors; Thyroiditis, Autoimmune; Young Adult","","Journal Article"
"19188532","Cumulative childhood stress and autoimmune diseases in adults.","Dube SR; Fairweather D; Pearson WS; Felitti VJ; Anda RF; Croft JB","Psychosomatic medicine","2009","OBJECTIVE: To examine whether childhood traumatic stress increased the risk of developing autoimmune diseases as an adult. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 15,357 adult health maintenance organization members enrolled in the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Study from 1995 to 1997 in San Diego, California, and eligible for follow-up through 2005. ACEs included childhood physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; witnessing domestic violence; growing up with household substance abuse, mental illness, parental divorce, and/or an incarcerated household member. The total number of ACEs (ACE Score range = 0-8) was used as a measure of cumulative childhood stress. The outcome was hospitalizations for any of 21 selected autoimmune diseases and 4 immunopathology groupings: T- helper 1 (Th1) (e.g., idiopathic myocarditis); T-helper 2 (Th2) (e.g., myasthenia gravis); Th2 rheumatic (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis); and mixed Th1/Th2 (e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia). RESULTS: Sixty-four percent reported at least one ACE. The event rate (per 10,000 person-years) for a first hospitalization with any autoimmune disease was 31.4 in women and 34.4 in men. First hospitalizations for any autoimmune disease increased with increasing number of ACEs (p < .05). Compared with persons with no ACEs, persons with >or=2 ACEs were at a 70% increased risk for hospitalizations with Th1, 80% increased risk for Th2, and 100% increased risk for rheumatic diseases (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood traumatic stress increased the likelihood of hospitalization with a diagnosed autoimmune disease decades into adulthood. These findings are consistent with recent biological studies on the impact of early life stress on subsequent inflammatory responses.","10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181907888","Adult; Adult Children; Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune; Autoimmune Diseases; California; Child; Child Abuse; Cohort Studies; Disease Susceptibility; Divorce; Domestic Violence; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Inflammation; Lymphokines; Male; Middle Aged; Myocarditis; Rheumatic Diseases; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Th1 Cells; Th2 Cells","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

Agents that can induce or maintain the opening of K(+) channels also offer a therapeutic approach to controlling of cell excitability and offer a means of producing stability in biological systems. The pathogenesis of a broad range of peripheral disorders (e.g., LQT syndrome, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, hyperinsulinism in infancy and erectile dysfunction) are associated with dysfunctional K(+) channels due to mutations in genes encoding channel proteins. The therapeutic potential of KCOs in peripheral K(+) channelopathies is discussed. The identification of K(+) channel subtype-specific openers offers discrete modulation of cellular systems creating a realistic therapeutic advance in the treatment of K(+) channelopathies.","10.1517/13543784.10.7.1345","Adenosine Triphosphatases; Drugs, Investigational; Ion Channel Gating; Potassium Channels","","Journal Article; Review"
