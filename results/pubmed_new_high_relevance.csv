However, no specific treatment has been proposed to date. To our knowledge, this is the first (pilot) study aiming to investigate the effect of an 8-week tailored physiotherapy program on the sexual health of women with SSc and IIM. METHODS: In total, 12 women with SSc and 4 women with IIM were enrolled in the study. Based on the patients' capability to participate in the program, they were divided into an intervention group (IG) (mean ± SD age 46.8 ± 8.6 years) and a control group (CG) (mean ± SD age 46.3 ± 8.5 years). IG underwent the 8-week program (1 h of supervised physiotherapy twice weekly), whereas CG received no physiotherapy. At weeks 0 and 8, all patients filled in questionnaires assessing sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI], Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women [BISF-W]), sexual quality of life (Sexual Quality of Life-Female [SQoL-F]), functional ability (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]), quality of life (Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 [SF-36]), and depression (Beck's Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]). The changes were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Friedmann's test. RESULTS: Compared to the statistically significant deterioration in CG over weeks 0-8, we found statistically significant improvements in the total scores of FSFI and BISF-W, and some of their domains, functional status, and the physical component of quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our 8-week physiotherapy program not only prevented the natural course of progressive deterioration of functional ability but also led to a significant improvement in sexual function and quality of life in women with SSc and IIM. However, due to the lack of randomization and a relatively small sample size resulting from the strict inclusion criteria, further validation of our results is needed.

25356310,"The relationship between sexual function and quality of sleep in caregiving mothers of sons with duchenne muscular dystrophy.","Nozoe KT; Hachul H; Hirotsu C; Polesel DN; Moreira GA; Tufik S; Andersen ML","Sexual medicine",2014,"INTRODUCTION: The task of the caregiver, especially a caregiving mother of a son with a chronic and fatal disease, may interfere with their quality of sleep, sexuality, and some hormone levels. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the sexual function and the quality of sleep of caregiving mothers of sons with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). METHODS: We evaluated 20 caregiving mothers of sons with DMD and 20 caregiving mothers of sons without any neuromuscular or chronic disease. All of them voluntarily responded to the evaluating questionnaires about their sexuality and their quality of sleep, and gave blood samples to evaluate their hormonal levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All mothers were evaluated using the questionnaire of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Pittsburgh questionnaire (PSQI). The blood samples were tested to determine serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, progesterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol. RESULTS: Caregiving mothers of sons with DMD had significantly lower scores in the FSFI questionnaire, suggesting a higher risk for sexual dysfunction. The PSQI demonstrated that these caregiving mothers present increased sleep latency, reduced sleep efficiency, daytime dysfunction, and poor sleep quality. Blood tests showed a rise in cortisol levels, which correlated with the compromised sexuality and quality of sleep. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that caregiving mothers of sons with DMD show major risk for sexual dysfunction and a reduction in their quality of sleep mediated in part by the hormonal changes related to stress.

In order to further restrict the region we screened for deletions in a set of 38 patients. We found two overlapping deletions in boys that in addition to MTM1 showed an unexpected abnormal genital development. As the latter phenotype is not found in the other non-deleted MTM1 patients, our observations are best explained by a contiguous gene syndrome. The deletions define a 430 kb region that contains the MTM1 gene and most likely a gene implicated in male sexual development.

Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are characterized by impaired muscle function with a majority of patients developing sustained disability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient's individual priorities (patient preference) of disabilities most important to improve in PM/DM using the MacMaster Toronto Arthritis Patient Preference Disability Questionnaire (MACTAR), to correlate the MACTAR to myositis outcomes and to evaluate its test-retest reliability. Methods. Twenty-eight patients with PM/DM performed recommended outcomes as well as the MACTAR, which was performed twice with one week apart. Results. Sexual activity, walking, biking, social activities, and sleep constituted the predominating disabilities. Seventy-two and 33% of the identified disabilities were not covered by items of the Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Myositis Activities Profile. Correlations between the MACTAR and health-related quality of life measures were r(s) = -0.67-0.73, correlations with measures of activities of daily living and participation in society were r(s) = 0.51-0.60 with lower correlations for other outcomes. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and weighted Kappa (K(w)) coefficients were 0.83 and 0.68, respectively, for test-retest reliability of the MACTAR. Conclusions. The MACTAR interview had promising measurement properties and identified patient preference disabilities in PM/DM that were not covered by recommended outcomes.","10.5402/2011/463124","","","Journal Article"

Non-motor symptoms explored in this population-based study include pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal issues, poor sleep, low mood, anxiety, problematic saliva, apathy, emotional lability, cognitive complaints and sexual dysfunction. People registered on the Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation of motor neuron disease platform, the Scottish Motor Neuron Disease Register, were invited to complete a questionnaire on non-motor symptoms and a self-reported Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale. The questionnaire comprised a pre-defined list of 11 potential non-motor symptoms, with the opportunity to list additional symptoms. A total of 120 individuals participated in this cross-sectional study, a 39% response rate of those sent questionnaires (n = 311); 99% of participants recruited (n = 120) experienced at least one non-motor symptom, with 72% (n = 120) reporting five or more. The symptoms most often reported were pain and fatigue (reported by 76% of participants, respectively). The symptoms reported to be most impactful were gastrointestinal issues (reported as 'severe' by 54% of participants who experienced them), followed by pain and problematic saliva (51%, respectively). Lower Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale scores, indicating more advanced disease and being a long survivor [diagnosed over 8 years ago; Black et al. (Genetic epidemiology of motor neuron disease-associated variants in the Scottish population. Neurobiol Aging. 2017;51:178.e11-178.e20.)], were significantly associated with reporting more symptoms; 73% of respondents were satisfied with the frequency that non-motor symptoms were discussed in clinical care; 80% of participants indicated they believe evaluation of non-motor symptom is important to include as outcomes in trials, independent of their personal experience of these symptoms. The preferred method of assessment was completing questionnaires, at home. The overwhelming majority of people with motor neuron disease report non-motor symptoms and these frequently co-occur. Pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal issues, sleep, mood, anxiety, problematic saliva, apathy, emotional lability, cognitive complaints and sexual dysfunction are prevalent. People with motor neuron disease who had worse physical function and those who were long survivors were more likely to report more symptoms. Where reported, these symptoms are frequent, impactful and a priority for people with motor neuron disease in clinical care and trial design.","10.1093/braincomms/fcad336","","impact; motor neuron disease; non-motor symptoms; prevalence; survey","Journal Article"

Despite the research efforts, currently there is no cure for ALS. In recent years, multiple epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. A pathological role for histone hypoacetylation and the abnormal NF-κB/RelA activation involving deacetylation of lysines, with the exclusion of lysine 310, has been established in ALS. Recent findings indicate that the pathological acetylation state of NF-κB/RelA and histone 3 (H3) occurring in the SOD1(G93A) murine model of ALS can be corrected by the synergistic combination of low doses of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-sirtuin 1 pathway activator resveratrol and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors MS-275 (entinostat) or valproate. The combination of the epigenetic drugs, by rescuing RelA and the H3 acetylation state, promotes a beneficial and sexually dimorphic effect on disease onset, survival and motor neurons degeneration. In this mini review, we discuss the potential of the epigenetic combination of resveratrol with HDAC inhibitors in the ALS treatment.","10.3389/fphar.2022.1017364","","NF-κB/RelA; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); epigenetic drugs; histone acetylation; histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors; resveratrol; sexual dimorphism","Journal Article; Review"

Previous studies have primarily focused on how baseline cardiac characteristics affect mortality, but the impact of non-cardiac baseline characteristics is less defined. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed/Medline (1990-2019) to identify studies that assessed the impact of baseline ATTR-PN characteristics on survival. Outcomes were first summarized descriptively. Extracted survival data were then disaggregated, and parametric mixture models were used to assess survival differences among patient groups defined by factors known to affect survival. RESULTS: The search yielded 1193 records, of which 35 were retained for analysis. Median survival ranged from 0.5 to > 25 years. The largest survival differences were between cohorts who underwent liver transplantation (LTx) versus those who did not. Among LTx cohorts, pre-LTx ATTR-PN disease duration ≥ 7 years, poor nutritional status, and late disease onset reduced median survival by 13, 12, and 10 years, respectively. Other prognostic survival factors included non-Val30Met genotype and baseline presence of urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or muscle weakness. CONCLUSION: Survival in patients with ATTR-PN is highly variable and affected by non-cardiac baseline characteristics, such as autonomic dysfunction, large fiber involvement, late-onset disease, and non-Val30Met mutation. Careful interpretation of these findings is warranted given that this synthesis did not control for differences between studies. Survival in patients with ATTR-PN remains poor among those who are untreated or with delayed diagnosis.","10.1007/s40120-020-00183-7","","Amyloidosis; Mortality; Polyneuropathy; Prognosis; Survival; Transthyretin","Journal Article"

Clinical practice",2019,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improve patient's outcome. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common complication of hATTR amyloidosis. However, because CTS is also common in the general population, we wanted to assess whether CTS, when associated with systemic manifestations, could help direct physicians to screen for TTR gene mutation and early diagnosis. METHODS: We reviewed the charts and interviewed the patients with hATTR seen between 2017 and 2018. We noted the details of CTS diagnosis, treatment, and other systemic features of the disease. RESULTS: Seventeen of the 23 patients studied had CTS. CTS was the first manifestation of the disease in 10 of 17 patients. On average, CTS symptoms occurred 10.4 years before their diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis. In 6 of 10 patients with CTS, the following systemic symptoms were present as the first manifestation: erectile dysfunction, dysautonomia, polyneuropathy, exercise intolerance, and gastrointestinal and ocular symptoms. CONCLUSION: CTS occurs in most patients with hATTR amyloidosis and frequently precedes the hATTR diagnosis. Most patients with CTS preceding hATTR diagnosis have systemic features. Recognizing systemic features at the time of CTS presentation may help in early diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis.","10.1212/CPJ.0000000000000640","","","Journal Article"
23776379,"Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy: current and emerging treatment options for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.","Hund E","The application of clinical genetics",2012,"Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is a fatal clinical disorder characterized by extracellular deposition of abnormal fibrils derived from misfolded, normally soluble transthyretin (TTR) molecules. The disease is most commonly caused by a point mutation within the TTR gene inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Over 100 of such mutations have been identified, leading to destabilization of the physiological TTR tetramer. As a result, many monomers originate with a tendency for spontaneous conformational changes and self-aggregation. The main clinical feature of TTR-FAP is progressive sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. In the beginning, this polyneuropathy predominantly involves small unmyelinated nerve fibers with the result of dissociated sensory loss disproportionately affecting sensation of pain and temperature. Autonomic neuropathy typically accompanies sensory deficits early in the disease course. The symptoms include orthostatic hypotension, constipation alternating with diarrhea, erectile dysfunction, anhydrosis, and urinary retention or incontinence. Later, involvement of motor fibers causes rapidly progressive weakness and gait disturbances. In addition to the peripheral nervous system, the heart and the gut are frequently affected. Onset of symptoms is bimodal, with one peak at age 33 years (early onset) and another distinct peak in the sixth decade of life (late onset). The course of TTR-FAP is uniformly progressive and fatal. Death occurs an average of 10.8 years after the onset of symptoms in Portuguese patients, and 7.3 years in late-onset Japanese patients. Common causes include cachexia, cardiac failure, arrhythmia, and secondary infections. Liver transplantation is the standard therapy for patients who are in a clinical condition good enough to tolerate this intervention because it stops progression of neuropathy by removing the main source of mutant TTR. Recently, orally administered tafamidis meglumine has been approved by European authorities for treatment of FAP. The substance has been shown to stabilize the TTR tetramer, thereby improving the outcome of patients with TTR-FAP. Various other strategies have been studied in vitro to prevent TTR amyloidosis, including gene therapy, immunization, dissolution of TTR aggregates, and free radical scavengers, but none of them is ready for clinical use so far.","10.2147/TACG.S19903","","FAP; amyloidosis; therapy; transthyretin; treatment","Journal Article"
