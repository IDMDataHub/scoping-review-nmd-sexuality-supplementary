Among them, Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging and reemerging arthropod-borne flavivirus that has become a major international public health problem following multiple large outbreaks over the past two decades. The majority of infections caused by ZIKV exhibit mild symptoms. However, the virus has been found to be associated with a variety of congenital neural abnormalities, including microcephaly in children and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. The exact prediction of the potential of ZIKV transmission is still enigmatic and underlines the significance of routine detection of the virus in suspected areas. ZIKV transmission from mother to fetus (including fetal abnormalities), viral presence in immune-privileged areas, and sexual transmission demonstrate the challenges in understanding the factors governing viral persistence and pathogenesis. This review illustrates the transmission patterns, epidemiology, control strategies (through vaccines, antivirals, and vectors), oncolytic aspects, molecular insights into neuro-immunopathogenesis, and other neuropathies caused by ZIKV. Additionally, we summarize in vivo and in vitro models that could provide an important platform to study ZIKV pathogenesis and the underlying governing cellular and molecular mechanisms.","10.3390/ijms26010047","Humans; Zika Virus Infection; Zika Virus; Animals; Guillain-Barre Syndrome","animal and cell models; antivirals; mosquito/vector control; neuropathies; neuropathogenesis; neurotropic flaviviruses; oncolytic; prevention; transmission; treatment; vaccines; zika virus","Journal Article; Review"
"39692000","""It doesn't get more normal than that!"" - challenges with sexuality experienced by people with neuromuscular diseases and their needs for rehabilitation knowledge and guidance on sexual life.","Møller JPK; Hansen KW; Handberg C","Disability and rehabilitation","2025","PURPOSE: To investigate challenges with sexuality experienced by people with neuromuscular diseases and their needs for knowledge and guidance on sexual life to target future rehabilitation services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 11 semi-structured individual interviews with 10 women and one man with neuromuscular diseases. The methodology was Interpretive Description, using the Crip Theory as the theoretical lens to guide the analysis. RESULTS: The sexual expression of people with neuromuscular diseases was affected by three overall themes. Knowledge and approach in society was characterized by a dichotomous relation of being disabled or nondisabled, causing the nondisabled to consider people with neuromuscular diseases to be asexual even though sexual notions were not affected by the neuromuscular disease. Perceptions and notions represented discovering and unfolding sexuality and how a limited representation of people with disabilities in the public discourse made it difficult to find inspirational role models. Self-confidence and autonomy demonstrated how the personal assistants or partners play significant roles to ensure autonomy of people with neuromuscular diseases. CONCLUSION: The challenges related to how sexuality of people with neuromuscular diseses was affected by the lack of knowledge and general approach in society which was either silence or misconceived considerations. The healthcare professionals' reluctance toward addressing sexuality should be considered when planning rehabilitation services. To enhance the knowledge and strengthen rehabilitation counseling on sexuality for people with neuromuscular disease (NMD) it is important to provide:Knowledge from sexual advisors who can contribute with education of healthcare professionals for them to initiate conversations and counseling regarding sexual topics, and to expand the representation of disability in the sexuality debate.Knowledge and counseling, from health professionals on sexuality when living with a NMD that should be provided from an early stage of the disease and for parents of young people with NMD to decrease stigmatization and reduce taboo.Counseling and guidance from sexual advisors on how to practically perform sex with an impaired function and on attention on hiring personal assistants who can be trusted to support during intimate tasks.Professionally structured peer support for young and adult people with NMD to understand their sexual feelings and bodies through role models and shared experiences to enhance the feeling of belonging and normalcy.Information on possible exercises in physiotherapy for hips, legs, jaws which may promote flexibility and mobility.","10.1080/09638288.2024.2440635","Humans; Neuromuscular Diseases; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Sexuality; Persons with Disabilities; Interviews as Topic; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Qualitative Research; Sexual Behavior; Aged; Self Concept","Neuromuscular disease; crip theory; healthcare professionals; interpretive description; qualitative research; rehabilitation; sexuality; stigma","Journal Article"

A high percentage of women with IC/BPS also experience pelvic floor muscle pain (PFMP). This study investigated he association between PFMP and clinical characteristics in patients with IC/BPS. METHOD: This study evaluated the extent and severity of PFMP in women with IC and BPS. Demographics, sexual condition, IC symptom index (ICSI), IC problem index (ICPI), and Beck anxiety inventory and depression inventory were assessed. The objective assessment items included bladder wall thickness in computed tomography, urodynamic parameters, maximum bladder capacity (MBC) and glomerulation grade after cystoscopic hydrodistention, urine inflammatory proteins, and oxidative stress biomarkers. RESULT: A total of 9 women with IC and 83 with BPS were enrolled. A total of 85.8% of patients had PFMP. Patients with PFMP had higher rates of dyspareunia (p = 0.005), lack of sexual activity (p < 0.001), more comorbidities (p = 0.039), pain-predominant IC/BPS phenotypes (p = 0.04), higher IC symptoms (ICSI, p = 0.003; ICPI, p < 0.001), and higher levels of urinary biomarker MIP-1β (p = 0.004) than patients without PFMP. However, no significant correlation was found between PFMP and the bladder wall thickness, urodynamic parameters, MBC, or glomerulation grade. CONCLUSION: PFMP is present in a high percentage of patients with IC and BPS and associated with higher IC/BPS symptom score and dyspareunia, but not with MBC or glomerulation grade in patients with BPS.","10.1007/s00345-024-05366-7","Humans; Cystitis, Interstitial; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Pain Perception; Severity of Illness Index; Urinary Bladder; Myalgia; Symptom Assessment; Pelvic Pain; Pelvic Floor","Bladder pain syndrome; Dyspareunia; Interstitial cystitis; Pelvic floor muscle; Pelvic floor muscle pain","Journal Article"

Although widely considered asymptomatic, cases involving voiding difficulties or pain have been reported. The aims of this study were, firstly, to describe the clinical presentation of patients with symptomatic MSMCs, secondly, to assess the impact of the cyst on nerve root function, and, thirdly, to assess whether nerve root injury is more frequent in patients with MSMCs than those with Tarlov cysts (TCs). METHODS: Consecutive patients with MSMCs presenting with at least one pelvic symptom participated in a cross-sectional review of symptoms using validated questionnaires. Findings of pelvic neurophysiology (pudendal sensory evoked potentials, sacral dermatomal sensory evoked potentials, external anal sphincter electromyography) and urodynamic testing were collected retrospectively. The relationship between neurophysiology, magnetic resonance imaging findings and patients' symptoms were assessed using Fisher's and analysis of variance tests. Neurophysiology findings were compared with those of TC patients. RESULTS: Eleven female patients were included (mean age 42.3 ± 12.4 years). All reported urinary symptoms. Back pain (91%), radicular leg pain (91%), bowel symptoms (45%) and sexual dysfunction (75%) were also frequently reported. Nine patients (82%) had abnormal findings on neurophysiology; three patients (27%) had one abnormal test, and six (55%) had two abnormal tests. Patients with MSMCs were more likely to have at least two abnormal neurophysiology test results compared to TC patients (55% vs. 18%, respectively; p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that MSMCs are indeed associated with injury to the sacral somatic innervation when symptomatic. MSMCs are more likely to cause sacral nerve root damage compared to TCs.","10.1111/ene.16530","Humans; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Tarlov Cysts; Sacrum; Retrospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory","lower urinary tract symptoms; meningeal cyst; pelvic neurophysiology; sacrum; spinal nerve roots","Journal Article"

While acetylcholine (Ach) is integral to erectile function, its role and mechanisms in NED need further exploration. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inhibition of CCMSCs Apoptosis and Protein Degradation Pathway by Ach in NED rat model. METHODS: We investigated changes in Ach secretion and receptor expression in an NED rat model, followed by the evaluation of apoptosis and ubiquitin proteasome activation in hypoxic Cavernous smooth muscle cells (CCMSCs) and their co-cultures with Schwann cells (SWCs), under Ach influence. Further, key pathways in NED were identified via high-throughput sequencing, focusing on the p38/MAPK signaling pathway. We examined gene alterations related to this pathway using hypoxic cell models and employed p38 inhibitors to verify protein changes. Our findings in vitro were then confirmed in the NED rat model. RESULTS: Nerve injury led to reduced Ach receptors and associated gene expression. Experimentally, Ach was shown to counteract CCMSC apoptosis and muscle protein degradation via the p38/MAPK pathway. Inhibition of the Ach degradation pathway demonstrated a capacity to slow NED progression in vivo. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Activation of Ach receptors may decelerate denervation-induced cavernosal muscle atrophy, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for NED. This study highlights the crucial role of the Ach/p38/MAPK axis in the pathophysiology of penis smooth muscle atrophy and its broader implications in managing NED and male erectile dysfunction.","10.1016/j.yexcr.2024.114283","Animals; Male; Erectile Dysfunction; Rats; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Muscular Atrophy; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Acetylcholine; Apoptosis; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Denervation; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Signal Transduction; Schwann Cells","Acetylcholine; Apoptosis; Muscular atrophy; Neurotraumatic erectile dysfunction; p38/MAPK","Journal Article"

METHODS: A total of 27 survey responses including 13 PALS and 14 partners were received. Surveys included both quantitative and qualitative data addressing the importance of sexual intimacy to quality of life, assistance required to participate in sexual intimacy, concerns for safety, and preferred timing and method of discussing/receiving information from healthcare professionals. RESULTS: 100% of respondents stated they had never been asked about sexual intimacy by any healthcare provider. 92% of participants agreed ALS had affected their ability to express sexual intimacy. Participants discussed loss of intimacy as due to muscle weakness, respiratory concerns, and role change among other contributors to the overall experienced change in expression of sexual intimacy. With regards to their preferred method of receiving/discussing information on the effect of ALS on sexual intimacy, 48% of participants preferred use of an online video series, 44% chose a pamphlet, 24% chose a one-on-one discussion with a healthcare provider, and 12% chose a private conversation with their partner and healthcare provider.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PRP administration on axon and collagen regeneration in CNI. A true experimental study using a post-test-only control group design was conducted. Twenty-five male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus), weighing 200-300 grams, were divided into five groups: two control groups (sham procedure and negative control), and three experimental groups receiving local PRP, intraperitoneal PRP, and a combination of local and intraperitoneal PRP. The cavernous nerve was injured with a hemostasis clamp for one minute before 200 µL of 200 PRP was injected locally, intraperitoneally, or both, depending on the group. After four weeks, the rats were euthanized, tissue segments (2 mm) from each cavernous nerve and mid-penis were collected and analyzed for collagen density, axon diameter, and number of myelinated axons. Our study found that collagen growth was slower in CNI group without PRP (sham procedure) compared to all PRP groups (local, intraperitoneal, and combination). The intraperitoneal PRP group had the highest collagen density at 5.62 µm; however, no significant difference was observed in collagen density among all groups (p=0.056). Similar axon diameter was found across the groups, with no statistically significant difference observed (p=0.856). In the number of myelinated axons, a significant difference was found among all groups with significantly more axons in local PRP and combined local and intraperitoneal PRP groups compared to others (p=0.026). In conclusion, PRP administration improved the number of myelinated axons in CNI, suggesting PRP role in CNI regeneration and the potential for an innovative approach to treating erectile dysfunction associated with CNI.","10.52225/narra.v4i2.880","Animals; Male; Platelet-Rich Plasma; Rats, Wistar; Collagen; Rats; Nerve Regeneration; Axons; Penis; Erectile Dysfunction; Disease Models, Animal; Peripheral Nerve Injuries","Platelet-rich plasma; axon; cavernous nerve injury; collagen; erectile dysfunction","Journal Article"
"39265373","Magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with peptides for the targeted repair of cavernous nerve injury underlying erectile dysfunction.","Liang X; Wang Z; Wang S; Ruan F; Zhang Y; Shao D; Liu X; Chen F; Shi X","Biomaterials","2025","Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common male sexual disorder characterized by repeated or persistent difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erection. It can arise from various factors, with cavernous nerve injury (CNI) from radical prostatectomy being a predominant cause of iatrogenic ED, posing significant clinical concerns. The complexity of cavernous tissue damage in CNI-induced ED (CNIED) often results in poor efficacy and resistance to conventional vascular ED treatments. To address CNI-induced ED, this study developed a system of magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) loaded with peptides for targeted treatment. Core-shell Fe3O4-coated MSNs were used as drug carriers and loaded with RADA16-I/RAD-RGI peptides (PD) to create a neurotrophic microenvironment to treat peripheral nerve defects. Furthermore, the neuro-targeting peptide HLNILSTLWKYR (PT) was grafted onto MSNs. The in vivo therapeutic effect was evaluated using a rat bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI) model. The results showed that the neuro-targeted Fe3O4@SiO2-PT-PD nanoparticles significantly promoted regeneration of the cavernous nerve and restored erectile function. This promising strategy offers significant clinical potential for treating CNI-induced ED. Nanomedicine technology has the potential to not only improve treatment outcomes but also reduce side effects in healthy cells, paving the way for more accurate targeted repair of cavernous nerve damage.","10.1016/j.biomaterials.2024.122811","Male; Animals; Erectile Dysfunction; Silicon Dioxide; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Peptides; Penis; Porosity; Rats; Nerve Regeneration; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Peripheral Nerve Injuries","Cavernous nerve injury; Erectile dysfunction; Magnetic mesoporous nanoparticles; Nerve regeneration","Journal Article"

However, LBP trials that have utilized the biopsychosocial approach to treatment have largely neglected sexual activity, which is an important social component of individuals with LBP. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine the effects of manual therapy plus sexual advice (MT+SA) compared with manual therapy (MT) or exercise therapy (ET) alone in the management of individuals with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy (DHR) and to determine the best sexual positions for these individuals. METHODS: This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty-four participants diagnosed as having chronic DHR (>3 months) were randomly allocated into three groups with 18 participants each in the MT+SA, MT and ET groups. The participants in the MT+SA group received manual therapy (including Dowling's progressive inhibition of neuromuscular structures and Mulligan's spinal mobilization with leg movement) plus sexual advice, those in the MT group received manual therapy only and those in the ET group received exercise therapy only. Each group received treatment for 12 weeks and then followed up for additional 40 weeks. The primary outcomes were pain, activity limitation, sexual disability and kinesiophobia at 12 weeks post-randomization. RESULTS: The MT+SA group improved significantly better than the MT or ET group in all outcomes (except for nerve function), and at all timelines (6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post-randomization). These improvements were also clinically meaningful for back pain, leg pain, medication intake, and functional mobility at 6 and 12 weeks post-randomization and for sexual disability, activity limitation, pain catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia at 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post-randomization (p<0.05). On the other hand, many preferred sexual positions for individuals with DHR emerged, with ""side-lying"" being the most practiced sexual position and ""standing"" being the least practiced sexual position by females. While ""lying supine"" was the most practiced sexual position and ""sitting on a chair"" was the least practiced sexual position by males. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that individuals with DHR demonstrated better improvements in all outcomes when treated with MT+SA than when treated with MT or ET alone. These improvements were also clinically meaningful for sexual disability, activity limitation, pain catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia at long-term follow-up. There is also no one-size-fits-all to sexual positioning for individuals with DHR.","10.1515/jom-2023-0075","Humans; Female; Radiculopathy; Male; Exercise Therapy; Single-Blind Method; Musculoskeletal Manipulations; Adult; Middle Aged; Lumbar Vertebrae; Treatment Outcome; Low Back Pain; Sexual Behavior; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Combined Modality Therapy","lumbar radiculopathy; manual therapy; randomized controlled trial; sexual advice","Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Comparative Study"

Physiotherapie Canada","2024","PURPOSE: We present the development and the key elements of a clinical practice guideline (CPG) in physiotherapy aiming to address sexuality, more specifically impairments and limitations that can interfere with sexual activity in adults with a neuromuscular disorder (NMD). METHOD: The CPG was based on the Rare Knowledge Mining Methodological Framework (RKMMF) and included a literature review, consultation with physiotherapists, and validation by an interdisciplinary team. The EX-PLISSIT (extended, permission, limited information, specific suggestions, intensive therapy) model and the Competency Profile for physiotherapists in Canada were also used as frameworks to divide the CPG into sections. Here, we present the methodology for the CPG development and key elements related to physiotherapy assessment and treatment related to sexual activity in people with NMDs. RESULTS: An extensive CPG was developed through a literature review, consultations, and a validation process. A total of 75 articles were included in the review. Twelve physiotherapists and four health professionals reviewed the CPG. Physiotherapists should address the following in their assessment: relationships; assistance required during sexual activity; urinary, vaginal, or anorectal symptoms; erectile dysfunction; pain; fatigue; and the impact of the NMD on sexuality. Interventions can target physical activity, positioning, muscle weakness, fatigue, decreased range of motion, erectile dysfunction, sensitivity disorders, lubrication, pain, incontinence, and cardiorespiratory implications. CONCLUSIONS: The CPG promotes the importance of addressing sexuality and proposes different interventions that physiotherapists should integrate into their practice. OBJECTIF: présentation de la préparation et des éléments fondamentaux de directives cliniques en physiothérapie au sujet de la sexualité, notamment les atteintes et les limites qui peuvent compromettre l’activité sexuelle des adultes ayant un trouble neuromusculaire (TNM).

AIM: To assess the prevalence of pelvic pain worsened by orgasm in patients with endometriosis and explore its association with potential etiologic factors, including pelvic floor myalgia, uterine tenderness and adenomyosis, and central nervous system sensitization. METHODS: An analysis was done of a prospective data registry based at a tertiary referral center for endometriosis. Eligible participants were patients aged 18 to 50 years who were referred between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019, diagnosed with endometriosis, and subsequently underwent surgery at the center. Clinical features were compared between participants reporting worsening pelvic pain with orgasm and those without worsening pain with orgasm, including patient-reported variables, physical examination findings, and anatomic phenotyping at the time of surgery. Pelvic floor myalgia and uterine tenderness were assessed by palpation on pelvic examination, adenomyosis by ultrasound, and central nervous system sensitization via the Central Sensitization Inventory (range, 0-100). OUTCOMES: Outcomes included pelvic or lower abdominal pain in the last 3 months that worsened with orgasm (yes/no). RESULTS: Among 358 participants with endometriosis, 14% (49/358) reported pain worsened by orgasm while 86% (309/358) did not. Pain with orgasm was significantly associated with pelvic floor myalgia (55% [27/49] vs 35% [109/309]; Cohen's h = 0.40, P = .01) and higher scores on the Central Sensitization Inventory (mean ± SD, 53.3 ± 17.0 vs 42.7 ± 18.2; Cohen's d = 0.60, P < .001) but not with uterine tenderness or adenomyosis. Other clinical features associated with pain with orgasm were poorer sexual health (higher scores: deep dyspareunia, Cohen's h = 0.60; superficial dyspareunia, Cohen's h = 0.34; and Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised, Cohen's d = 0.68; all P < .05) and poorer mental health (higher scores: Patient Health Questionnaire-9, 12.9 ± 6.7 vs 9.1 ± 6.3, Cohen's d = 0.59, P < .001; Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, 9.4 ± 5.6 vs 6.8 ± 5.5, Cohen's d = 0.48, P = .002). Anatomic findings at the time of surgery did not significantly differ between the groups. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Interventions targeting pelvic floor myalgia and central nervous system sensitization may help alleviate pain worsened by orgasm in patients with endometriosis. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: A strength is that pain worsened by orgasm was differentiated from dyspareunia. However, pain with orgasm was assessed by only a binary question (yes/no). Also, the study is limited to a single center, and there were limited data on sexual function. CONCLUSION: Pelvic pain exacerbated by orgasm in people with endometriosis may be related to concurrent pelvic floor myalgia and central sensitization.","10.1093/jsxmed/qdae084","Humans; Female; Endometriosis; Orgasm; Adult; Pelvic Pain; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Adenomyosis; Myalgia; Central Nervous System Sensitization; Young Adult; Pelvic Floor; Prevalence; Adolescent","central nervous system sensitization; endometriosis; orgasm; pelvic floor disorders; pelvic pain","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Our main objective was to examine the prevalence of neuropathic pain in women with symptomatic endometriosis, and secondary, to explore the factors associated with this type of pain and to assess the prevalence of a positive PPSC score and a history of sexual violence within this population. This study is a retrospective, comparative, single-center cohort study conducted from September 2019 to January 2023. The presence of neuropathic pain was confirmed by a positive DN4 score, defined as greater than or equal to 4. The association with the following variables was studied: age, BMI, marital status, smoking, alcohol and drugs consumption, age at menarche, gestity, parity, duration of exposure to endometriosis, MRI locations, laparoscopy for endometriosis and post-laparoscopy r-ASRM classification, hormone treatment, associated symptoms, VAS, associated pathologies, infertility consultation, Pain Center consultation, EPH-5 score, positive PPSC score (≥5), and history of sexual violence. The prevalence of neuropathic pain was 44.1%. Younger age, being in a relationship, having a high EPH-5 score and undergoing laparoscopy for endometriosis are associated with neuropathic pain independently of other variables. Our study underscores the persistent high prevalence of neuropathic pain in endometriosis cases, emphasizing the importance of actively screening for it. Identifying neuropathic pain could prompt referrals to pain specialists, integrating it into a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach.","10.1016/j.ejogrb.2024.07.013","Humans; Female; Endometriosis; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Prevalence; Neuralgia; Pain Measurement; Pelvic Pain; Middle Aged; Sex Offenses; Young Adult","DN4; EPH-5; Endometriosis; Neuropathic pain; PPSC","Journal Article"
"39002881","A novel animal model of symptomatic neuroma for assessing neuropathic pain.","Berberoglu I; Sabbagh SW; Cederna PS; Kemp SWP","Neuroscience letters","2024","INTRODUCTION: Following amputation, peripheral nerves lack distal targets for regeneration, often resulting in symptomatic neuromas and debilitating neuropathic pain. Animal models can establish a practical method for symptomatic neuroma formation for better understanding of neuropathic pain pathophysiology through behavioral and histological assessments. We created a clinically translatable animal model of symptomatic neuroma to mimic neuropathic pain in patients and assess sexual differences in pain behaviors. METHODS: Twenty-two male and female rats were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups: (1) neuroma surgery, or (2) sham surgery. For the neuroma experimental group, the tibial nerve was transected in the thigh, and the proximal segment was placed under the skin for mechanical testing at the site of neuroma. For the sham surgery, rats underwent tibial nerve isolation without transection. Behavioral testing consisted of neuroma-site pain, mechanical allodynia, cold allodynia, and thermal hyperalgesia at baseline, and then weekly over 8 weeks. RESULTS: Male and female neuroma rats demonstrated significantly higher neuroma-site pain response compared to sham groups starting at weeks 3 and 4, indicating symptomatic neuroma formation. Weekly assessment of mechanical and cold allodynia among neuroma groups showed a significant difference in pain behavior compared to sham groups (p < 0.001). Overall, males and females did not display significant differences in their pain responses.

"38989790","Sexual health and fertility in Duchenne muscular dystrophy-An exploratory study.","Hoskin J; Cheetham TD; Mitchell RT; Wong SC; Wood CL","Muscle & nerve","2024","INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Recent clinical guidelines recommend that adolescents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are on daily glucocorticoid treatment should be offered pubertal induction in order to ensure adult levels of sex hormones as they reach adulthood. However, it remains unclear how gonadal status, including androgen concentrations, impacts physical function and future fertility. The aim of this study was to give a voice to adults with DMD, exploring their perspectives around sexual health, hormone treatment, and fertility. METHODS: Qualitative data was collected from six adults with DMD through two online focus groups. Participants were recruited through Pathfinders Neuromuscular Alliance and Duchenne UK and invited to take part if they had DMD and were 18 years of age or older. Conversations were transcribed verbatim and an interpretivist paradigm was used with thematic analysis. RESULTS: The main themes identified were (1) the need for communication and information about sexual health, (2) dealing with the potential fear of rejection, (3) physical barriers to relationships including sex, (4) testosterone supplementation in DMD, and (5) parenthood and fertility. DISCUSSION: We recommend that clinicians work with young people with DMD individually, to explore the benefits of testosterone treatment for them and their personal sexual health needs. If they are offered treatment, this should always be accompanied by the opportunity for psychological support. This work highlights the need for further research to establish the role of testosterone supplementation in adults with DMD and its effects on fertility and the value of specific emotional and practical support for sexual health.","10.1002/mus.28201","Humans; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Male; Adult; Sexual Health; Fertility; Female; Young Adult; Testosterone; Adolescent; Qualitative Research; Focus Groups","Duchenne muscular dystrophy; disability; fertility; psychosocial; sexuality; testosterone","Journal Article"
"38965379","Brain-body mechanisms contribute to sexual dimorphism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Jacob SM; Lee S; Kim SH; Sharkey KA; Pfeffer G; Nguyen MD","Nature reviews. Neurology","2024","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of human motor neuron disease. It is characterized by the progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to generalized motor weakness and, ultimately, respiratory paralysis and death within 3-5 years. The disease is shaped by genetics, age, sex and environmental stressors, but no cure or routine biomarkers exist for the disease. Male individuals have a higher propensity to develop ALS, and a different manifestation of the disease phenotype, than female individuals. However, the mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain a mystery. In this Review, we summarize the epidemiology of ALS, examine the sexually dimorphic presentation of the disease and highlight the genetic variants and molecular pathways that might contribute to sex differences in humans and animal models of ALS. We advance the idea that sexual dimorphism in ALS arises from the interactions between the CNS and peripheral organs, involving vascular, metabolic, endocrine, musculoskeletal and immune systems, which are strikingly different between male and female individuals. Finally, we review the response to treatments in ALS and discuss the potential to implement future personalized therapeutic strategies for the disease.","10.1038/s41582-024-00991-7","Humans; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Sex Characteristics; Male; Female; Animals; Brain","","Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
"38942945","Surgical approaches for pudendal nerve entrapment: insights from a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Mylle T; De Corte R; Hervé F; Everaert K; Bou Kheir G","Surgical endoscopy","2024","BACKGROUND: Pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) is an underdiagnosed condition affecting a spectrum of pelvic functions, primarily pain, as outlined by Nantes diagnostic criteria. Although numerous surgical decompression techniques are available for its management, consensus on efficacy and safety is lacking. This study conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and complication rates of the main surgical decompression techniques. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed®, Embase®, Web of Science®, and ClinicalTrails.gov® on 19th of April 2023. Initial screening involved title and abstract evaluation, with subsequent retrieval and assessment of abstracts and full-text articles. Studies assessing pain outcomes before and after surgical release of the pudendal nerve were included. Studies without full-text, focusing on diagnostic methods or with outcomes relating solely to LUTS, digestive symptoms, or sexual dysfunction, were excluded. Risk of bias assessement was conducted using the National Institute of Health (NIH) Study Quality Assessment tool. Studies were categorized based on three surgical techniques: perineal, transgluteal, and laparoscopic transperitoneal. Random-effects meta-analysis with subgroup analysis were used. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of covariates on the observed outcomes. RESULTS: Nineteen studies, comprising 810 patients, were included. The overall significant pain relief rate across all techniques was estimated at 0.67 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.78) with considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 80.4%). Subgroup analysis revealed success rate for different techniques: laparoscopic (0.91, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98), perineal (0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), and transgluteal (0.50, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.63). The laparoscopic technique exhibited a complication rate of 16.0%. Meta-regression indicated that patient age and median follow-up significantly influenced outcomes. CONCLUSION: While comparing surgical techniques is challenging, this meta-analysis highlights important outcome differences. The laparoscopic technique appears most promising for pain improvement. However, the study also emphasizes the need for further robust, long-term research due to significant heterogeneity across studies and prevelent risk of bias.

Hence, we sought to characterize autonomic impairment in primary lateral sclerosis. METHODS: Neurological evaluations, thermoregulatory sweat tests, and autonomic reflex screens were analyzed retrospectively in 34 primary lateral sclerosis patients (28 definite and 6 probable). Patients with other potential causes of autonomic failure and patients with autonomic testing results compromised by artifact were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients reported autonomic symptoms. Orthostatic lightheadedness was most frequent (8 patients), followed by bladder (7), bowel (5), and erectile dysfunction (3). The autonomic reflex screens of 33 patients were reviewed; 20 patients had abnormal studies. The thermoregulatory sweat tests of 19 patients were reviewed; 11 patients had abnormal studies. Composite Autonomic Severity Score was calculated for 33 patients and found abnormal in 20/33 patients (60.6%): 15/20 patients (75%) had mild impairment, and 5/20 patients (25%) had moderate impairment. The frequencies of testing abnormalities were: sudomotor 18/20 (90%), cardiovagal 9/20 (45%), and adrenergic 6/20 (30%). Sweat loss pattern analysis showed global, regional, and mixed patterns to be more common than length-dependent and distal patterns. CONCLUSION: We found evidence of frequent autonomic dysfunction in primary lateral sclerosis, which is generally of modest severity akin to prior reports for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but more commonly in a pattern consistent with preganglionic/ganglionic localization. This suggests that primary lateral sclerosis, as with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a multisystem disease that affects the autonomic nervous system.","10.1007/s10286-024-01039-y","Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Female; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Aged; Sweating; Motor Neuron Disease; Autonomic Nervous System","ARS; Anhidrosis; Autonomic; PLS; TST","Journal Article"

Early detection of PCa allows for a potentially curative intervention. Most men will live over a decade from the time of their PCa diagnosis. Thus, treatments must balance curative interventions with their impact on quality of life. Radical prostatectomy (RP) is one such potentially curative intervention but often leads to erectile dysfunction (ED) and urinary incontinence (UI). Approximately 90,000 RPs are performed each year in the USA. Post-operative ED and UI is thought to occur in part from traumatic peripheral nerve injury (TPNI) to the neurovascular bundles that surround the prostate. Thus, patients undergoing RP may be a population that would benefit from clinical studies that look at TPNI. METHODS: The study is a single-institution, double-blinded placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in which patients immediately post-RP receive either 4-aminopyrdine (4AP) or placebo in a 1:1 fashion. The primary outcome is evaluation of the efficacy of 4AP in accelerating the early return of baseline erectile and urinary function post-radical prostatectomy. DISCUSSION: This study is critical as it could reduce the morbidity associated with RP, a commonly performed operation, and identify a patient population that may greatly benefit into further TPNI research.

OBJECTIVE: Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare neurologic condition with potentially devastating consequences. The objective of this study was to compare the 2-year postoperative cost-associated treatments after posterior spinal decompression between patients with and without CES. METHODS: By analyzing a commercial insurance claims database, patients who underwent posterior spinal decompression with a concurrent diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis, radiculopathy, or disk herniation in 2017 were identified and included in the study. The primary outcome was the cost of payments for identified treatments in the 2-year period after surgery. Treatments included were (1) physical therapy (PT), (2) pain medication, (3) injections, (4) bladder management, (5) bowel management, (6) sexual dysfunction treatment, and (7) psychological treatment. RESULTS: In total, 3,140 patients (age, 55.3 ± 12.0 years; male, 62.2%) were included in the study. The average total cost of treatments identified was $2,996 ± 6,368 per patient. The overall cost of identified procedures was $2,969 ± 6,356 in non-CES patients, compared with $4,535 ± 6,898 in patients with CES ( P = 0.079). Among identified treatments, only PT and bladder management costs were significantly higher for patients with CES (PT: +115%, P < 0.001; bladder management: +697%, P < 0.001). The difference in overall cost was significant between patients (non-CES: $1,824 ± 3,667; CES: $3,022 ± 4,679; P = 0.020) in the first year. No difference was found in the second year. DISCUSSION: A short-term difference was observed in costs occurring in the first postoperative year.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of pudendal nerve neurolysis (PNN) in improving lower urinary tract symptoms, anal and/or urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunctions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on 20 May 2023 using Scopus, PubMed, and Embase. Only English and adult papers were included. Meeting abstracts and preclinical studies were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-one papers were accepted, revealing significant findings in the field. The study identified four primary sites of pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE), with the most prevalent location likely being at the level of the Alcock canal. Voiding symptoms are commonly exhibited in patients with PNE. PNN improved both urgency and voiding symptoms, and urinary and anal incontinence but is less effective in cases of long-standing entrapment. Regarding sexual function, the recovery of the somatic afferent pathway results in an improvement in erectile function early after neurolysis. Complete relief of persistent genital arousal disorder occurs in women, although bilateral PNN is necessary to achieve the efficacy. PNN is associated with low-grade complications. CONCLUSIONS: PNN emerges as a viable option for addressing urinary symptoms, fecal incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and female sexual arousal in patients suffering from PNE with minimal postoperative morbidity.","10.4111/icu.20230402","Humans; Pudendal Nerve; Pudendal Neuralgia; Fecal Incontinence; Treatment Outcome; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Nerve Block; Male Urogenital Diseases; Female Urogenital Diseases; Urinary Incontinence","Erectile dysfunction; Lower urinary tract symptoms; Pudendal nerve entrapment; Pudendal nerve neurolysis; Pudendal neuralgia","Systematic Review; Journal Article"

The authors aimed to investigate the most valuable predictors (MVPs) of poor postoperative recovery (PPR) in patients with CES and construct a nomogram for discerning those who will experience PPR. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-six patients with CES secondary to lumbar degenerative diseases treated at Xijing Hospital were randomly divided into training ( N =238) and validation ( N =118) cohorts at a 2:1 ratio. Moreover, 92 patients from the 970 th Hospital composed the testing cohort. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression (LASSO) was used for selecting MVPs. The nomogram was developed by integrating coefficients of MVPs in the logistic regression, and its discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility were validated in all three cohorts. RESULTS: After 3 to 5 years of follow-up, the residual rates of bladder dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and saddle anesthesia were 41.9, 44.1, 63.7, and 29.0%, respectively. MVPs included stress urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, low stream, difficult defecation, fecal incontinence, and saddle anesthesia in order. The discriminatory ability of the nomogram was up to 0.896, 0.919, and 0.848 in the training, validation, and testing cohorts, respectively. Besides, the nomogram showed good calibration and clinical utility in all cohorts. Furthermore, the optimal cutoff value of the nomogram score for distinguishing those who will experience PPR was 148.02, above which postoperative outcomes tend to be poor.

RESULTS: One superordinate theme was generated: ""Sexuality forever altered, it's changed completely,"" reflecting the enduring impact of CES on women's sexuality. Five subordinate themes emerged reflecting a range of changed roles and relationships, primarily associated with loss of sexual identity and a sense that health professionals did not prioritize sexual functioning (1): Loss of worth as a sexual being: ""Feel like a nothing"" (2) Relationships have changed: ""It's not a meeting of equals anymore"" (3) Lack of professional support: ""We don't like to talk about anything below the waist"" (4) Challenges for motherhood: ""What kind of future will they have with a mother like me…"" and (5) Finding ways of coping: ""Closed the door on it.""

More specifically, we examined incidents reported between the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2023. The imbalance of risdiplam-related AEs was evaluated by computing the reporting odds ratio. A total of 5,406,334 reports were thoroughly reviewed.

Eleven experts participated with backgrounds in urology, urogynecology, minimally invasive gynecology, and pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) participated. Panelists were asked to rate their agreement with rated evidence-based statements regarding HTPFD treatment. Statements reaching consensus were used to generate a consensus treatment algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 31 statements were reviewed by group members at the first Delphi round with 10 statements reaching consensus. 28 statements were reposed in the second round with 17 reaching consensus. The putative algorithm met clinical consensus in the third round. There was universal agreement for PFPT as first-line treatment for HTPFD. If satisfactory symptom improvement is reached with PFPT, the patient can be discharged with a home exercise program. If no improvement after PFPT, second-line options include trigger or tender point injections, vaginal muscle relaxants, and cognitive behavioral therapy, all of which can also be used in conjunction with PFPT. Onabotulinumtoxin A injections should be used as third line with symptom assessment after 2-4 weeks. There was universal agreement that sacral neuromodulation is fourth-line intervention. The largest identified barrier to care for these patients is access to PFPT. For patients who cannot access PFPT, experts recommend at-home, guided pelvic floor relaxation, self-massage with vaginal wands, and virtual PFPT visits. CONCLUSION: A stepwise approach to the treatment of HTPFD is recommended, with patients often necessitating multiple lines of treatment either sequentially or in conjunction. However, PFPT should be offered first line.","10.1097/AOG.0000000000005536","Humans; Female; Pelvic Floor; Physical Therapy Modalities; Exercise Therapy; Pelvic Floor Disorders; Pelvic Pain","","Journal Article"

In drawing up these multidisciplinary clinical practice recommendations, the French National Authority for Health (Haute Autorité de santé, HAS) conducted an exhaustive review of the literature concerning the diagnosis, prevention, and management of complications associated with POP surgery using a synthetic mesh. Each recommendation for practice was allocated a grade (A,B or C; or expert opinion (EO)), which depends on the level of evidence (clinical practice guidelines). PREOPERATIVE PATIENTS' INFORMATION: Each patient must be informed concerning the risks associated with POP surgery (EO). HEMORRHAGE, HEMATOMA: Vaginal infiltration using a vasoconstrictive solution is not recommended during POP surgery by the vaginal route (grade C). The placement of vaginal packing is not recommended following POP surgery by the vaginal route (grade C). During laparoscopic sacral colpopexy, when the promontory seems highly dangerous or when severe adhesions prevent access to the anterior vertebral ligament, alternative surgical techniques should be discussed per operatively, including colpopexy by lateral mesh laparoscopic suspension, uterosacral ligament suspension, open abdominal mesh surgery, or surgery by the vaginal route (EO). BLADDER INJURY: When a bladder injury is diagnosed, bladder repair by suturing is recommended, using a slow resorption suture thread, plus monitoring of the permeability of the ureters (before and after bladder repair) when the injury is located at the level of the trigone (EO). When a bladder injury is diagnosed, after bladder repair, a prosthetic mesh (polypropylene or polyester material) can be placed between the repaired bladder and the vagina, if the quality of the suturing is good. The recommended duration of bladder catheterization following bladder repair in this context of POP mesh surgery is from 5 to 10 days (EO). URETER INJURY: After ureteral repair, it is possible to continue sacral colpopexy and place the mesh if it is located away from the ureteral repair (EO). RECTAL INJURY: Regardless of the approach, when a rectal injury occurs, a posterior mesh should not be placed between the rectum and the vagina wall (EO). Concerning the anterior mesh, it is recommended to use a macroporous monofilament polypropylene mesh (EO). A polyester mesh is not recommended in this situation (EO). VAGINAL WALL INJURY: After vaginal wall repair, an anterior or a posterior microporous polypropylene mesh can be placed, if the quality of the repair is found to be satisfactory (EO). A polyester mesh should not be used after vaginal wall repair (EO). MESH INFECTION (ABSCESS, CELLULITIS, SPONDYLODISCITIS): Regardless of the surgical approach, intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended (aminopenicillin + beta-lactamase inhibitor: 30 min before skin incision +/- repeated after 2 h if surgery lasts longer) (EO). When spondylodiscitis is diagnosed following sacral colpopexy, treatment should be discussed by a multidisciplinary group, including especially spine specialists (rheumatologists, orthopedists, neurosurgeons) and infectious disease specialists (EO). When a pelvic abscess occurs following synthetic mesh sacral colpopexy, it is recommended to carry out complete mesh removal as soon as possible, combined with collection of intraoperative bacteriological samples, drainage of the collection and targeted antibiotic therapy (EO). Non-surgical conservative management with antibiotic therapy may be an option (EO) in certain conditions (absence of signs of sepsis, macroporous monofilament polypropylene type 1 mesh, prior microbiological documentation and multidisciplinary consultation for the choice of type and duration of antibiotic therapy), associated with close monitoring of the patient. BOWEL OCCLUSION RELATED TO NON-CLOSURE OF THE PERITONEUM: Peritoneal closure is recommended after placement of a synthetic mesh by the abdominal approach (EO). URINARY RETENTION: Preoperative urodynamics is recommended in women presenting with urinary symptoms (bladder outlet obstruction symptoms, overactive bladder syndrome or incontinence) (EO). It is recommended to remove the bladder catheter at the end of the procedure or within 48 h after POP surgery (grade B). Bladder emptying and post-void residual should be checked following POP surgery, before discharge (EO). When postoperative urine retention occurs after POP surgery, it is recommended to carry out indwelling catheterization and to prefer intermittent self-catheterization (EO). POSTOPERATIVE PAIN: Before POP surgery, the patient should be asked about risk factors for prolonged and chronic postoperative pain (pain sensitization, allodynia, chronic pelvic or non-pelvic pain) (EO). Concerning the prevention of postoperative pain, it is recommended to carry out a pre-, per- and postoperative multimodal pain treatment (grade B). The use of ketamine intraoperatively is recommended for the prevention of chronic postoperative pelvic pain, especially for patients with risk factors (preoperative painful sensitization, allodynia, chronic pelvic or non-pelvic pain) (EO). Postoperative prescription of opioids should be limited in quantity and duration (grade C). When acute neuropathic pain (sciatalgia or pudendal neuralgia) resistant to level I and II analgesics occurs following sacrospinous fixation, a reintervention is recommended for suspension suture removal (EO). When chronic postoperative pain occurs after POP surgery, it is recommended to systematically seek arguments in favor of neuropathic pain with the DN4 questionnaire (EO). When chronic postoperative pelvic pain occurs after POP surgery, central sensitization should be identified since it requires a consultation in a chronic pain department (EO). Concerning myofascial pain syndrome (clinical pain condition associated with increased muscle tension caused by myofascial trigger points), when chronic postoperative pain occurs after POP surgery, it is recommended to examine the levator ani, piriformis and obturator internus muscles, so as to identify trigger points on the pathway of the synthetic mesh (EO). Pelvic floor muscle training with muscle relaxation is recommended when myofascial pain syndrome is associated with chronic postoperative pain following POP surgery (EO). After failure of pelvic floor muscle training (3 months), it is recommended to discuss surgical removal of the synthetic mesh, during a multidisciplinary discussion group meeting (EO). Partial removal of synthetic mesh is indicated when a trigger point is located on the pathway of the mesh (EO). Total removal of synthetic mesh should be discussed during a multidisciplinary discussion group meeting when diffuse (no trigger point) chronic postoperative pain occurs following POP surgery, with or without central sensitization or neuropathic pain syndromes (EO). POSTOPERATIVE DYSPAREUNIA: When de novo postoperative dyspareunia occurs after POP surgery, surgical removal of the mesh should be discussed (EO). VAGINAL MESH EXPOSURE: To reduce the risk of vaginal mesh exposure, when hysterectomy is required during sacral colpopexy, subtotal hysterectomy is recommended (grade C). When asymptomatic vaginal macroporous monofilament polypropylene mesh exposure occurs, systematic imaging is not recommended. When vaginal polyester mesh exposure occurs, pelvic +/- lumbar MRI (EO) should be used to look for an abscess or spondylodiscitis, given the greater risk of infection associated with this type of material. When asymptomatic vaginal mesh exposure of less than 1 cm2 occurs in a woman with no sexual intercourse, the patient should be offered observation (no treatment) or local estrogen therapy (EO). However, if the patient wishes, partial excision of the mesh can be offered. When asymptomatic vaginal mesh exposure of more than 1 cm2 occurs or if the woman has sexual intercourse, or if it is a polyester prosthesis, partial mesh excision, either immediately or after local estrogen therapy, should be offered (EO). When symptomatic vaginal mesh exposure occurs, but without infectious complications, surgical removal of the exposed part of the mesh by the vaginal route is recommended (EO), and not systematic complete excision of the mesh. Following sacral colpopexy, complete removal of the mesh (by laparoscopy or laparotomy) is only required in the presence of an abscess or spondylodiscitis (EO). When vaginal mesh exposure recurs after a first reoperation, the patient should be treated by an experienced team specialized in this type of complication (EO). SUTURE THREAD VAGINAL EXPOSURE: For women presenting with vaginal exposure to non-absorbable suture thread following POP surgery with mesh reinforcement, the suture thread should be removed by the vaginal route (EO). Removal of the surrounding mesh is only recommended when vaginal mesh exposure or associated abscess is diagnosed. BLADDER AND URETERAL MESH EXPOSURE: When bladder mesh exposure occurs, removal of the exposed part of the mesh is recommended (grade B). Both alternatives (total or partial mesh removal) should be discussed with the patient and should be debated during a multidisciplinary discussion group meeting (EO).","10.1016/j.ejogrb.2024.01.015","Humans; Female; Surgical Mesh; Polypropylenes; Quality of Life; Abscess; Discitis; Dyspareunia; Hyperalgesia; Pelvic Organ Prolapse; Vagina; Prostheses and Implants; Urinary Bladder Diseases; Postoperative Pain; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Estrogens; Myofascial Pain Syndromes; Neuralgia; Pelvic Pain; Polyesters; Treatment Outcome","Colpopexy; Complications mesh; Cystocele; Exposure; Guidelines; Mesh; Pelvic organ prolapse; Polypropylene; Vaginal mesh exposure","Review; Journal Article"

All protease inhibitor monotherapy versus ongoing triple therapy in the long-term management of HIV infection (PIVOT) trial participants with data on PN at baseline were included in the study. NfL plasma levels (pNfL) were measured in a sub-set of participants. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations of PN with potential risk factors (including age, sex, nadir CD4 cell count, history of dideoxynucleoside (d-drugs) exposure, and blood glucose levels) and NfL levels. Of the 585 participants included, 131 (22.4%) reported PN during the study period (median of 44 months). The participants were predominantly male (76.6%), White (68.2%), and virologically suppressed for a median period of 37 months (range of 20-63) before recruitment. The age at baseline was 44.3 years (standard deviation (SD) of 9.2). PN was independently associated with age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.35, 95% CI of 1.20-1.52; additional 5 years), history of d-drugs (aOR 1.88, 95% CI of 1.12-3.16), height (aOR 1.19, 95% CI of 1.05-1.35; additional 5 cm), nadir CD4 cell count (aOR 1.10 CI of 1.00-1.20; 50 cells fewer), and metabolic syndrome (aOR 2.31, 95% CI of 1.27 4.20), but not pNfL. The excess risk for PN associated with d-drug use remains after the exposure has stopped for years, suggesting non-reversible toxicity. In people with HIV, metabolic syndrome is independently associated with PN. There was no additional value for pNfL as a screening test for peripheral neuropathy in effectively virologically suppressed adults living with HIV.","10.3390/v16010002","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; HIV Infections; Metabolic Syndrome; Risk Factors; Protease Inhibitors; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases","HIV; metabolic syndrome; monotherapy; peripheral neuropathy; protease inhibitor","Journal Article"

Studies have shown that programmed cell death factor 4 is connected to the modulation of apoptosis in many cells. However, the programmed cell death factor 4 function in the cavernous nerve injury erectile dysfunction is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This investigation aimed to explore the programmed cell death factor 4 function in erectile dysfunction in rats with bilateral cavernous nerve crush. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiment used 30 male Sprague Dawley rats (18 months old) that were screened for normal erectile function by the apomorphine test. Ten rats were randomized into Sham and bilateral cavernous nerve crush groups to detect changes in programmed cell death factor 4 expression. The remaining 20 rats were distributed at random to four groups: the Sham group treated by sham surgery, the phosphate-buffered saline group, the lentivirus containing negative control short hairpin RNA group, and the lentivirus containing short hairpin RNA targeting programmed cell death factor 4 group underwent bilateral cavernous nerve crush and were afterward administered intracavernous injections of phosphate-buffered saline, lentivirus containing negative control short hairpin RNA, or lentivirus containing short hairpin RNA targeting programmed cell death factor 4. Electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve was conducted 2 weeks later for penile erectile function assessment. The cavernous tissue was collected for histological analysis and western blotting. RESULTS: The apoptosis level in rat corpus cavernosum was elevated, and programmed cell death factor 4 expression was increased after bilateral cavernous nerve crush. Knockdown of programmed cell death factor 4 significantly improved erectile function in bilateral cavernous nerve crush rats. Furthermore, lentivirus containing short hairpin RNA targeting programmed cell death factor 4 treatment raised smooth muscle content and attenuated cavernous fibrosis and apoptotic levels. Additionally, programmed cell death factor 4 was found to mediate the PI3K/AKT pathway. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Elevated programmed cell death factor 4 expression may be an important pathogenetic mechanism for erectile dysfunction after bilateral cavernous nerve crush, and the knockdown of programmed cell death factor 4 enhanced erectile function in 18-month-old rats after cavernous nerve damage. The potential mechanism may be the stimulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway to attenuate the cavernous apoptosis level.","10.1111/andr.13592","Animals; Male; Apoptosis; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Erectile Dysfunction; Rats; Penis; Penile Erection; Nerve Crush; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; Peripheral Nerve Injuries","PDCD4; apoptosis; cavernous nerve; erectile dysfunction; rats","Journal Article"

We are presenting a patient who had MNGIE syndrome and presented with anejaculation for the first time in the literature. A 27-year-old male patient applied to the urology clinic with anejaculation. It was learned that the patient had lifelong anejaculation and had no problems with libido, erection, or orgasm from his sexual history. In the evaluation of the etiology of anejaculation, the patient did not have any known causes of anejaculation. From the patient's medical history, it was learned that he was diagnosed with MNGIE syndrome when he presented to another hospital with gastrointestinal symptoms 5 years ago. Neurodegenerative diseases are the potential cause of anejaculation due to sensorimotor neuropathy and paresthesia. The patient was given genetic counseling and was informed about assisted reproductive techniques and that his partner should be screened for MNGIE syndrome. In conclusion, when evaluating neurodegenerative diseases, it is of great importance to question the patients' sexual problems, which are important for their quality of life, and to provide appropriate counseling.","10.1038/s41443-023-00813-2","Humans; Male; Adult; Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathies; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction; Ejaculation; Ejaculatory Dysfunction; Ophthalmoplegia; Mitochondrial Diseases; Muscular Dystrophy, Oculopharyngeal","","Journal Article; Case Reports; Review"

Spine","2024","Tarlov perineurial spinal cysts (TCs) are an underrecognized cause of spinal neuropathic symptoms. TCs form within the sensory nerve root sleeves, where CSF extends distally and can accumulate pathologically. Typically, they develop at the sacral dermatomes where the nerve roots are under the highest hydrostatic pressure and lack enclosing vertebral foramina. In total, 90% of patients are women, and genetic disorders that weaken connective tissues, e.g., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, convey considerable risk. Most small TCs are asymptomatic and do not require treatment, but even incidental visualizations should be documented in case symptoms develop later. Symptomatic TCs most commonly cause sacropelvic dermatomal neuropathic pain, as well as bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. Large cysts routinely cause muscle atrophy and weakness by compressing the ventral motor roots, and multiple cysts or multiroot compression by one large cyst can cause even greater cauda equina syndromes. Rarely, giant cysts erode the sacrum or extend as intrapelvic masses. Disabling TCs require consideration for surgical intervention. The authors' systematic review of treatment analyzed 31 case series of interventional percutaneous procedures and open surgical procedures. The surgical series were smaller and reported somewhat better outcomes with longer term follow-up but slightly higher risks. When data were lacking, authorial expertise and case reports informed details of the specific interventional and surgical techniques, as well as medical, physical, and psychological management. Cyst-wrapping surgery appeared to offer the best long-term outcomes by permanently reducing cyst size and reconstructing the nerve root sleeves. This curtails ongoing injury to the axons and neuronal death, and may also promote axonal regeneration to improve somatic and autonomic sacral nerve function.","10.3171/2023.9.SPINE23559","Humans; Axons; Spinal Nerve Roots; Spine; Tarlov Cysts","Tarlov cysts; diagnosis; perineurial cysts; sacral extradural meningeal cysts; therapeutics","Systematic Review; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

"37863988","Predicting female pelvic tilt and lumbar angle using machine learning in case of urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction.","Abdel Hady DA; Abd El-Hafeez T","Scientific reports","2023","Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as any uncontrolled urine leakage. Pelvic floor muscles (PFM) appear to be a crucial aspect of trunk and lumbo-pelvic stability, and UI is one indication of pelvic floor dysfunction. The evaluation of pelvic tilt and lumbar angle is critical in assessing the alignment and posture of the spine in the lower back region and pelvis, and both of these variables are directly related to female dysfunction in the pelvic floor. UI affects a significant number of women worldwide and can have a major impact on their quality of life. However, traditional methods of assessing these parameters involve manual measurements, which are time-consuming and prone to variability. The rehabilitation programs for pelvic floor dysfunction (FSD) in physical therapy often focus on pelvic floor muscles (PFMs), while other core muscles are overlooked. Therefore, this study aimed to predict the activity of various core muscles in multiparous women with FSD using multiple scales instead of relying on Ultrasound imaging. Decision tree, SVM, random forest, and AdaBoost models were applied to predict pelvic tilt and lumbar angle using the train set. Performance was evaluated on the test set using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2. Pelvic tilt prediction achieved R2 values > 0.9, with AdaBoost (R2 = 0.944) performing best. Lumbar angle prediction performed slightly lower with decision tree achieving the highest R2 of 0.976. Developing a machine learning model to predict pelvic tilt and lumbar angle has the potential to revolutionize the assessment and management of this condition, providing faster, more accurate, and more objective assessments than traditional methods.","10.1038/s41598-023-44964-0","Female; Humans; Quality of Life; Urinary Incontinence; Pelvic Floor; Physical Therapy Modalities; Muscular Diseases; Posture","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

DATA SOURCES: The ClinicalTrials.gov , PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to November 2022 by two independent assessors (B.L.K. and F.G.L.). Identified studies were screened by title and abstract and included after full-text review. Data extraction was subsequently performed and recorded in Microsoft Excel. METHODS: This study was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines after registration in PROSPERO (CRD42022289132). All randomized studies, prospective studies with more than five participants, and retrospective studies with more than 10 participants published in English or French and assessing the use of botulinum toxin for the treatment of pelvic floor tension myalgia and persistent pelvic pain in women were included. Meta-analyses were performed on randomized data. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Of 4,722 articles identified, 24 satisfied inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials totaling 329 participants demonstrated no differences in patient- and clinician-reported outcome measures, including pain, dyspareunia, sexual function, and vaginal manometry. Mean duration of follow-up was 6 months. A qualitative analysis of 14 prospective and four retrospective studies including 804 participants is supportive of botulinum toxin; however, the quality of data is low, and there is marked heterogeneity between studies. CONCLUSION: Meta-analyses of randomized data do not support the use of botulinum toxin to treat pelvic floor tension myalgia and persistent pelvic pain. Failure of these data to confirm the findings of nonrandomized prospective studies that suggest a treatment benefit may be attributable to the absence of placebo control and confounding outcomes obtained from an active comparator group.

We performed experiments in male and female rats with spared nerve injury (SNI) model of peripheral neuropathy. Mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed behaviorally by monofilaments. Discharge rates of pain-control neurons were determined using in vivo single unit recordings under light anesthesia. Recording targets were two medullary nuclei involved in descending pain control: the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus (DRt). Based on the response to peripheral noxious stimulus, neurons were classified as pronociceptive RVM ON-like or DRt neurons, or antinociceptive RVM OFF-like neurons. Behavioral results indicated that the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by SNI was significantly stronger in females than males. The ongoing discharge rates of pronociceptive RVM ON-like neurons were higher and those of antinociceptive RVM OFF-like neurons lower in SNI females than SNI males.

In patients with other diseases, there is evidence of an association between peripheral nervous system disorders and sexual dysfunction due to the impact of impaired neuronal control on genital organ sensitivity. In cancer patient interviews, it has now been observed that PNP and sexual dysfunction may be related. The aim of the study was to investigate the potential association between PNP, sexual dysfunction, and physical activity behavior. METHODS: Ninety-three patients with PNP of the feet and/or hands were interviewed in August/September 2020 in a cross-sectional study regarding medical history, sexual dysfunction and functionality of the genital organs. RESULTS: Thirty-one persons who participated in the survey provided seventeen evaluable questionnaires (four men, thirteen women). Nine women (69%) and three men (75%) reported sensory disorders of the genital organs. Three men (75%) had erectile dysfunction. All men who had sensory symptoms of the genital organs received chemotherapy, and one man also received immunotherapy. Eight women were sexually active. Five (63%) of them reported genital organ symptoms and mainly lubrication disorders. Four (80%) of the five sexually inactive women reported genital organ symptoms. Eight of the nine women with sensory symptoms of the genital organs received chemotherapy, and one woman received immunotherapy. DISCUSSION: Our limited data suggest genital organ sensory symptoms in chemotherapy and immunotherapy patients. Genital organ symptoms do not appear to be directly related to sexual dysfunction, and the association between PNP and genital organ symptoms appears to be more pronounced in sexually inactive women. Chemotherapy could cause sensory symptoms of the genital organs and sexual dysfunction by damaging genital organ nerve fibers. Chemotherapy and anti-hormone therapy (AHT) could trigger a disturbance of the hormone balance, which in turn could be causative for sexual dysfunction. It remains open whether the cause of these disorders is the symptomatology of the genital organs or the altered hormone balance. The significance of the results is limited due to the small number of cases. To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind in cancer patients and allows a better understanding of the association between PNP, sensory symptoms of the genital organs, and sexual dysfunction. CONCLUSION: In order to be able to narrow down the cause of these initial observations in cancer patients more precisely, larger studies are needed that can relate the influence of cancer therapy-induced PNP, physical activity level and hormone balance to sensory symptoms of the genital organs and sexual dysfunction. The methodology of further studies should take into account the frequent problem of low response rates in surveys on sexuality. EINLEITUNG: Polyneuropathie (PNP) in Füßen und/oder Händen und sexuelle Dysfunktion sind häufige Nebenwirkungen von Krebstherapien. Bei Patient*innen mit anderen Erkrankungen gibt es Hinweise auf einen Zusammenhang zwischen Erkrankungen des peripheren Nervensystems und der sexuellen Dysfunktion aufgrund des Einflusses der gestörten neuronalen Kontrolle auf die Sensibilität der Genitalorgane. In Gesprächen mit Krebspatient*innen wurde nun beobachtet, dass die PNP und die sexuelle Dysfunktion möglicherweise zusammenhängen. Ziel der Studie war, den potentiellen Zusammenhang zwischen PNP, sexueller Dysfunktion und körperlichem Aktivitätsverhalten zu untersuchen. METHODEN: Dreiundneunzig Patient*innen mit PNP der Füße und/oder Hände wurden im August/September 2020 in einer Querschnittuntersuchung bezüglich Krankengeschichte, sexueller Dysfunktion und Funktionalität der Genitalorgane befragt. ERGEBNISSE: Einunddreißig Personen, die an der Umfrage teilnahmen, lieferten siebzehn auswertbare Fragebögen (vier Männer, dreizehn Frauen). Neun Frauen (69%) und drei Männer (75%) berichteten über Gefühlsstörungen an den Geschlechtsorganen. Drei Männer (75%) hatten eine erektile Dysfunktion. Alle Männer, die sensorische Beeinträchtigungen der Genitalorgane aufwiesen, erhielten Chemotherapie, und ein Mann zudem Immuntherapie. Acht Frauen waren sexuell aktiv. Fünf (63%) von ihnen berichteten von Symptomen der Genitalorgane und hauptsächlich Lubrikationsstörungen. Vier (80%) der fünf sexuell inaktiven Frauen berichteten von Symptomen der Genitalorgane. Acht der neun Frauen mit sensorischen Symptomen der Genitalorgane erhielten Chemotherapie und eine Frau erhielt Immuntherapie. DISKUSSION: Unsere begrenzten Daten deuten auf sensorische Symptome der Genitalorgane bei Chemotherapie- und Immuntherapie-Patient*innen hin. Symptome der Genitalorgane scheinen nicht direkt mit sexueller Dysfunktion zusammenzuhängen und der Zusammenhang zwischen PNP und Symptomen der Genitalorgane scheint bei sexuell inaktiven Frauen ausgeprägter zu sein. Chemotherapie könnte durch Schädigung von Nervenfasern der Genitalorgane sensorische Symptome im Genitalbereich und eine sexuelle Dysfunktion verursachen. Chemotherapie und Anti-Hormontherapie (AHT) könnten eine Störung des Hormonhaushaltes auslösen, die wiederum ursächlich für eine sexuelle Dysfunktion sein könnte. Es bleibt offen, ob eine Symptomatik an den Genitalorganen oder der veränderte Hormonhaushalt Ursache dieser Störungen ist. Die Aussagekraft der Ergebnisse ist aufgrund der geringen Fallzahl eingeschränkt. Diese Untersuchung ist nach unserer Kenntnis die erste dieser Art bei Krebspatient*innen und ermöglicht ein besseres Verständnis für den Zusammenhang von PNP, sensorischen Symptomen der Genitalorgane und sexueller Dysfunktion. FAZIT: Um die Ursache dieser ersten Beobachtungen bei Krebspatient*innen genauer eingrenzen zu können, sind größere Studien notwendig, die den Einfluss der Krebstherapie-induzierten PNP, des körperlichen Aktivitätsniveaus und des Hormonhaushalts auf die sensorischen Symptome der Genitalorgane und die sexuelle Dysfunktion in Beziehung setzen können. Bei der Methodik weiterer Studien sollte das häufig auftretende Problem der geringen Rücklaufquoten in Befragungen zur Sexualität berücksichtigt werden.","10.3205/000322","Male; Humans; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Behavior; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Antineoplastic Agents; Surveys and Questionnaires","exercise therapy; genital organs; oncology; peripheral neuropathy; physical activity; sexual dysfunction","Journal Article"

The most effective treatment of symptomatic Tarlov cysts, with options including non-surgical management, cyst aspiration and injection of fibrin glue, cyst fenestration, and nerve root imbrication, is debated. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted for 220 patients with Tarlov cysts seen at our institution between 2006 and 2021. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between treatment modality, patient characteristics, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Seventy-two (43.1%) patients with symptomatic Tarlov cysts were managed non-surgically. Of the 95 patients managed interventionally, 71 (74.7%) underwent CT-guided aspiration of the cyst with injection of fibrin glue; 17 (17.9%) underwent cyst aspiration alone; 5 (5.3%) underwent blood patching; and 2 (2.1%) underwent more than one of the aforementioned procedures. Sixty-six percent of treated patients saw improvement in one or more symptoms, with the most improvement in patients after aspiration of cyst with injection of fibrin glue; however, this association was not statistically significant on logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Although the subtype of percutaneous treatment was not significantly associated with optimal or suboptimal patient outcomes, cyst aspiration both with and without injection of fibrin glue may serve as a useful diagnostic tool to (1) determine symptom etiology and (2) identify patients who might have achieved temporary improvement between the time of cyst aspiration and refill with cerebrospinal fluid as potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention of cyst fenestration and nerve root imbrication.","10.1136/jnis-2023-020564","Humans; Tarlov Cysts; Female; Male; Retrospective Studies; Middle Aged; Fibrin Tissue Adhesive; Adult; Aged; Treatment Outcome; Aged, 80 and over; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","intervention; lumbosacral; spinal nerve; spine","Journal Article"

The many different skeletal muscles in mammals contain a spectrum of slow- to fast-twitch myofibres with varying levels of protein isoforms that determine their distinctive contractile, metabolic, and other properties. The variations in functional properties across the range of classic 'slow' to 'fast' myofibres are outlined, combined with exemplars of the predominantly slow-twitch soleus and fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus muscles, species comparisons, and techniques used to study these properties. Other intrinsic and extrinsic differences are discussed in the context of slow and fast myofibres. These include inherent susceptibility to damage, myonecrosis, and regeneration, plus extrinsic nerves, extracellular matrix, and vasculature, examined in the context of growth, ageing, metabolic syndrome, and sexual dimorphism. These many differences emphasise the importance of carefully considering the influence of myofibre-type composition on manifestation of various neuromuscular disorders across the lifespan for both sexes. Equally, understanding the different responses of slow and fast myofibres due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors can provide deep insight into the precise molecular mechanisms that initiate and exacerbate various neuromuscular disorders. This focus on the influence of different myofibre types is of fundamental importance to enhance translation for clinical management and therapies for many skeletal muscle disorders.","10.1111/apha.14012","Male; Animals; Female; Muscle Fibers, Fast-Twitch; Muscle Fibers, Slow-Twitch; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscle Contraction; Aging; Mammals","Duchenne muscular dystrophy; MyHC composition; ageing; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; atrophy; dysferlinopathy; glycogen storage diseases; metabolic syndrome; muscle damage; myofibre types; myonecrosis; myopathies; myosinopathies; neuromuscular disorders; sarcopenia; skeletal muscle; α-actinin-3 deficiency","Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

This descriptive study aimed to examine patients' experience of CIPN symptoms, daily limitations, involvement of healthcare professionals, and social support. METHODS: Cross-sectional data have been collected in the Netherlands via a national online questionnaire comprising closed items only (February 2021). RESULTS: Out of 3752 respondents, 1975 received chemotherapy only (i.e., without targeted therapy) and were therefore included. The majority (71.2%) reported symptoms in both hands and feet (e.g., tingling and loss of sensation or diminished sensation). Participants reported most limitations in household chores, social activities, hobbies, sports, walking, and sleeping and least in family/(taking care of) children, cycling, driving, self-care, eating and drinking, and sexuality and intimacy. Many patients indicated that their healthcare professionals informed them about the possibility of CIPN development before treatment (58.4%), and they paid attention to CIPN during and after treatment (53.1%). However, many patients (43%) reported a lack of information on what to do when CIPN develops. Few participants (22%) visited their general practitioner (GP) for CIPN. In general, patients' social environments sometimes to always showed empathy to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of CIPN are frequently reported and can result in various daily limitations. Support from professionals and peers is crucial in managing CIPN, which is sometimes lacking. Appropriate guidance and support should be provided to patients to decrease the impact of CIPN on daily life. Future research should investigate differences in chemotherapeutic agents and the resulting symptoms and consequences.","10.1007/s11764-023-01402-4","Humans; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Male; Cancer Survivors; Netherlands; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Middle Aged; Social Support; Health Personnel; Neoplasms; Antineoplastic Agents; Adult; Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Activities of Daily Living; Quality of Life; Young Adult","Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy; Daily limitations; Healthcare professionals; Self-reported; Social support; Symptoms","Journal Article"

The aim was to explore the relationship between TCs and sacral nerve root functions using pelvic neurophysiology tests, and to correlate changes with clinical symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. METHODS: Consecutive patients with sacral TCs, referred for pelvic neurophysiology testing and presenting with at least one symptom related to the pelvic area, participated in a cross-sectional review of symptoms using validated questionnaires. Findings of pelvic neurophysiology (pudendal sensory evoked potentials, sacral dermatomal sensory evoked potentials, external anal sphincter electromyography) and urodynamics testing were collected retrospectively. The relationship between neurophysiology, MRI findings and patients' symptoms was assessed using Fisher and ANOVA tests. RESULTS: Sixty-five females were included (mean age 51.2 ± 12.1 years). The commonest symptom was pain (92%). Urinary (91%), bowel (71%) and sexual (80%) symptoms were also frequently reported. Thirty-seven patients (57%) had abnormal neurophysiology findings reflecting sacral root dysfunction. No association was seen between MRI findings (size, location of the cysts, severity of compression) and neurophysiology. A negative association was observed between neurophysiology abnormalities and occurrence of urgency urinary incontinence (p = 0.03), detrusor overactivity (p < 0.01) and stress urinary incontinence (p = 0.04); however, there was no association with voiding difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to current understanding, TCs are associated with injury to the sacral somatic innervation in the majority of patients with presumed symptomatic cysts. However, urinary incontinence is unlikely to be related to TC-induced nerve damage.","10.1111/ene.15869","Female; Humans; Adult; Middle Aged; Tarlov Cysts; Retrospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Neurophysiology; Pain; Cysts; Urinary Incontinence","Tarlov cysts; lower urinary tract symptoms; pelvic neurophysiology; sacrum; spinal nerve roots","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

This study explores whether Physiotherapists are asking the correct questions, in the correct way and investigates their experiences when screening for this serious condition. Thirty physiotherapists working in a community musculoskeletal service were purposively sampled and participated in semi-structured interviews. Data was transcribed and thematically analysed. All participants routinely asked bladder, bowel function and saddle anaesthesia screening questions although only 9 routinely asked about sexual function. Whether questions are asked in the correct way has never been studied. Sufficient depth of questioning, using lay terminology and explicit language was achieved by two-thirds of participants. Less than half of the participants framed the questions before asking them and only 5 participants combined all four dimensions. Whilst most clinicians felt comfortable asking general CES questions, half reported feeling uncomfortable when asking about sexual function. Issues around; gender, culture and language were also highlighted. Four main themes emerged from this study; i) Physiotherapists ask the right questions but frequently omit sexual function questions, ii) mostly, Physiotherapists ask CES questions in a way that patients understand however, there needs to be improvement in framing the context of the questions, iii) Physiotherapists generally feel comfortable with CES screening but there is some awkwardness surrounding discussion of sexual function and iv) Physiotherapists perceive there to be barriers to effective CES screening caused by culture and language.","10.1016/j.msksp.2023.102773","Humans; Cauda Equina; Physical Therapists; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Qualitative Research; Physical Therapy Modalities","Assessment; Back pain; CES; Cauda equina syndrome; Physiotherapy; Screening","Journal Article"

We summarised and compared the findings from published observational studies on the clinical presentation and epidemiology of the 2022 and previous outbreaks of Mpox. METHODS: We registered a review protocol with the Open Science Framework (osf.io/j3kb7). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL and Scopus databases, and relevant websites up to August 30, 2022. Retrieved literature citations were screened for eligibility, and summary clinical presentation and epidemiological data from the included studies were pooled, when possible, using an inverse variance, random-effects model. RESULTS: Seventy-nine studies met the eligibility. Irrespective of outbreak, fever, headache, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, pleomorphic skin lesions, oral lesions, and sore throat were potentially highly relevant Mpox manifestations, while conjunctivitis, cough, and possibly reactivation of varicella zoster virus may be part of the clinical presentation.

However, models based on young and healthy rats reportedly exhibit spontaneous recovery of erectile function. Our investigation purpose was to evaluate bilateral CN crushing (BCNC) effects on erectile function besides penile corpus cavernosum pathology in young and old rats and verify whether the BCNC modeling in old rats is more suitable to mimic pRP-ED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty young and old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats had been divided into three groups in a random manner: sham-operated group (Sham), CN-injured 2-week group (BCNC-2W), and CN-injured 8-week group (BCNC-8W). At 2 and 8 weeks postoperatively, mean arterial pressure (MAP) along with intracavernosal pressure (ICP) had been determined, respectively. Then, the penis was harvested for histopathological studies. KEY FINDING: We found that young rats exhibited erectile function spontaneous recovery 8 weeks following BCNC, while old ones failed to recover erectile function. After BCNC, the abundance of nNOS-positive nerve and smooth muscle were reduced, whereas apoptotic levels and collagen I content increased. These pathological modifications gradually resumed over time in young rats, unlike in old rats. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate that 18-month-old rats do not spontaneously regain erectile function at 8 weeks after BCNC. Therefore, CN-injury ED modeling in 18-month-old rats may be more suitable for studying pRP-ED.","10.1016/j.lfs.2023.121767","Humans; Rats; Male; Animals; Erectile Dysfunction; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Disease Models, Animal; Penile Erection; Penis; Prostatectomy; Peripheral Nerve Injuries","Animal model; Cavernous nerve injury; Erectile dysfunction; Intracavernosal pressure","Journal Article"

Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) can be a potential strategy for neurogenic ED (NED). However, whether Schwann cells (SCs) can respond to LIPUS stimulation signals is unclear. This study aims to elucidate the signal transmission between SCs paracrine exosome (Exo) and neurons stimulated by LIPUS, as well as to analyze the role and potential mechanisms of exosomes in CN repair after injury. METHODS: The major pelvic ganglion (MPG) neurons and MPG/CN explants were stimulated with LIPUS of different energy intensities to explore the appropriate LIPUS energy intensity. The exosomes were isolated and purified from LIPUS-stimulated SCs (LIPUS-SCs-Exo) and non-stimulated SCs (SCs-Exo). The effects of LIPUS-SCs-Exo on neurite outgrowth, erectile function, and cavernous penis histology were identified in bilateral cavernous nerve crush injury (BCNI)-induced ED rats. RESULTS: LIPUS-SCs-Exo group can enhance the axon elongation of MPG/CN and MPG neurons compared to SCs-Exo group in vitro. Then, the LIPUS-SCs-Exo group showed a stronger ability to promote the injured CN regeneration and SCs proliferation compared to the SCs-Exo group in vivo. Furthermore, the LIPUS-SCs-Exo group increased the Max intracavernous pressure (ICP)/mean arterial pressure (MAP), lumen to parenchyma and smooth muscle to collagen ratios compared to the SCs-Exo group in vivo. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatics analysis revealed the differential expression of 1689 miRNAs between the SCs-Exo group and the LIPUS-SCs-Exo group. After LIPUS-SCs-Exo treatment, the phosphorylated levels of Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt) and forkhead box O (FoxO) in MPG neurons increased significantly compared to negative control (NC) and SCs-Exo groups. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that LIPUS stimulation could regulate the gene of MPG neurons by changing miRNAs derived from SCs-Exo, then activating the PI3K-Akt-FoxO signal pathway to enhance nerve regeneration and restore erectile function. This study had important theoretical and practical significance for improving the NED treatment.","10.1111/cns.14256","Animals; Male; Rats; Crush Injuries; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Exosomes; MicroRNAs; Nerve Regeneration; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Schwann Cells; Signal Transduction; Ultrasonic Waves","Schwann cells; erectile dysfunction; exosomes; low-intensity pulsed ultrasound; nerve regeneration","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The disease was assessed using the KD1234 scale and the spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy functional rating scale. The average age of disease onset was 30.8 ± 2.85 years. Clinically diagnosed members had 48 CAG repeats (≥35 is abnormal) in the androgen receptor gene. The patients exhibited gynecomastia and testicular dysfunction. The lesions mainly involved the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. Progesterone and serum creatine kinase levels were significantly high. Electromyography showed chronic neurogenic damage and abnormal sensory and motor conduction in family members who did not participate in sports, exercise, or physical hobbies. Our study showed that this family had a stable inheritance of CAG repeats, and the genotype was consistent with the clinical phenotype. Gynecomastia was the first symptom, with progressive androgen resistance resulting in testicular atrophy, infertility, and sexual dysfunction.

LCM was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day for 7 consecutive days. Erectile function was assessed by measuring the ratio of peak intracavernous pressure (ICP) to mean arterial pressure (MAP), and tissues were harvested for transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, Masson's trichrome staining, TUNEL staining, and Western blot analysis. The BCNI + 0.9% NS group showed reduced ICP/MAP ratio (0.93 ± 0.04 vs. 0.44 ± 0.05, P < 0.0001). An increased proportion of TUNEL-positive cells (0.04 ± 0.01 vs 0.87 ± 0.03, P < 0.0001) and a decreased smooth muscle/collagen ratio (0.44 ± 0.01 vs. 0.33 ± 0.01, P < 0.001) were observed in the BCNI + 0.9% NS compared with the sham group. Administration of LCM significantly restored the ICP/MAP ratio (0.44 ± 0.05 vs. 0.74 ± 0.05, P < 0.001) and decreased the proportion of TUNEL positive cells (0.87 ± 0.03 vs. 0.60 ± 0.04, P < 0.0001) in the corpus cavernosum following BCNI. The ratio of smooth muscle to collagen (0.43 ± 0.01vs. 0.33 ± 0.01, P < 0.01) and expression of α-SMA (P < 0.0001) in the BCNI + LCM group significantly increased compared with BCNI + 0.9% NS group, indicating alleviation of fibrosis. Apoptotic markers, including Bax/Bcl-2 (P < 0.01) and Caspase-3 (P < 0.0001) in the BCNI + LCM group was significantly lower than that in the BCNI + 0.9% NS group. LCM treatment partially upregulated the expression of vWF and eNOS in cavernous tissue in rats subjected to BCNI (P < 0.05).

We identified 191 phospholipid (PL) species and revealed an important sexual dimorphism in PLs in the diaphragm, with almost 60% of them being significantly different between male and female animals. In addition, 40% of phospholipids presented significant age-related differences. Interestingly, SELENON protein absence was responsible for remodeling of 10% PL content, completely different in males and in females. Expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in PL remodeling was higher in males compared to females. These results establish the diaphragm PL map and highlight an important PL remodeling pattern depending on sex, aging and partly on genotype. These differences in PL profile may contribute to the identification of biomarkers associated with muscular diseases and muscle aging.","10.3390/biomedicines11020234","","aging; cardiolipin; mass spectrometry; myopathy; phospholipid; selenoprotein N; sexual dimorphism; sphingomyelin","Journal Article"

However, the mechanisms of vitamin D3 remain unknown. Thus, we explored the effect of vitamin D3 on erectile function recovery after nerve injury in a rat model and investigated its possible molecular mechanisms. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control, bilateral cavernous nerve crush (BCNC), and BCNC + vitamin D3 groups. BCNC model was established in rats by surgery. The intracavernosal pressure and the ratio of intracavernosal pressure to mean arterial pressure were utilized to evaluate erectile function. Masson trichrome staining, immunohistochemistry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling and western blot analysis were performed on penile tissues to elucidate the molecular mechanism. The results indicated that vitamin D3 alleviated hypoxia and suppressed the fibrosis signalling pathway by upregulating the expression of eNOS (p = 0.001), nNOS (p = 0.018) and α-SMA (p = 0.025) and downregulating the expression of HIF-1α (p = 0.048) and TGF-β1 (p = 0.034) in BCNC rats. Vitamin D3 promoted erectile function restoration by enhancing the autophagy process through decreases in the p-mTOR/mTOR ratio (p = 0.02) and p62 (p = 0.001) expression and increases in Beclin1 expression (p = 0.001) and the LC3B/LC3A ratio (p = 0.041). Vitamin D3 application improved erectile function rehabilitation by suppressing the apoptotic process through decreases in the expression of Bax (p = 0.002) and caspase-3 (p = 0.046) and an increase in the expression of Bcl2 (p = 0.004). Therefore, We concluded that vitamin D3 improved the erectile function recovery in BCNC rats by alleviating hypoxia and fibrosis, enhancing autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis in the corpus cavernosum.","10.1038/s41443-023-00679-4","Animals; Male; Autophagy; Apoptosis; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Cholecalciferol; Rats; Erectile Dysfunction; Penis; Penile Erection; Disease Models, Animal; Recovery of Function; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Fibrosis","","Journal Article"

The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined and the effective therapy has been limited. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of riluzole and the role of PKC β and excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) mediating this effect in a rat model of bilateral cavernous injury (BCNI). A total of 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham, BCNI (at 7, 15 days post-injury) and BCNI treated with riluzole (8 mg/kg/day) groups. Erectile function was measured as maximum intracavernosal pressure (mICP)/mean arterial pressure (MAP) and total ICP/MAP. Changes in protein expressions of phospho (p)-PKC β IIser660 and EAATs were analysed in penis and major pelvic ganglion with western blotting. BCNI decreased erectile function at 7 and 15 days post-injury (mICP/MAP at 4 V: 0.45 ± 0.06 vs 0.84 ± 0.07; 0.34 ± 0.04 vs 0.77 ± 0.04 respectively; p < 0.001) whereas riluzole treatment (for 15 days) preserved erectile function (mICP/MAP at 4 V: 0.62 ± 0.03 vs 0.34 ± 0.04; p < 0.01). The decline in the expression of p-PKC β IIser660 was observed in penis at 7 and 15 days post-injury (p = 0.0003, p = 0.0033), which was prevented by riluzole treatment for 15 days (p = 0.0464). While expressions of EAAT-1 and EAAT-2 decreased in major pelvic ganglion following BCNI (p = 0.0428, p = 0.002), riluzole treatment for 15 days prevented the decrease only in EAAT-2 expression (p = 0.0456). Riluzole improved erectile function via possibly interacting with PKC β II and glutamatergic pathways, as a potential therapeutic candidate for erectile dysfunction.","10.1038/s41443-023-00680-x","Animals; Male; Riluzole; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Neuroprotective Agents; Penis; Penile Erection; Rats; Erectile Dysfunction; Protein Kinase C beta; Disease Models, Animal; Peripheral Nerve Injuries","","Journal Article"

However, related symptoms and signs are often nonspecific and confirmatory tests are required. We describe the age and frequency of early symptoms and diagnostic features among individuals of Jewish Yemenite descent in Israel. METHODS: Records of mutation carriers were retrospectively reviewed. ATTRS77Y diagnosis was defined by the presence of amyloid in tissue and/or amyloid-related cardiomyopathy. RESULTS: We identified the Ser77Tyr mutation at the heterozygous state in 19 amyloidosis patients (mean age at diagnosis: 62 ± 5.7 years, range 49-70) and 30 amyloid-negative carriers. The probability for disease diagnosis increased from 4.4% at age 49 to 100% at 70 and occurred earlier in males. Initial symptoms preceded diagnosis by 5 ± 3.8 years (range 0-12) and were commonly sensory changes in the extremities. Erectile dysfunction predated these in 8/13 (62%) males. In two patients cardiac preceded neurological symptoms. Two patients declined symptoms. Electrophysiological studies near the time of diagnosis indicated a median neuropathy at the wrist in 18/19 (95%) and polyneuropathy in 13/19 (68%). Skin biopsy revealed epidermal denervation in 15/16 (94%) patients. Cardiomyopathy was identified in 16/19 (84%). Sensory complaints or epidermal denervations were present in 17/30 (57%) of amyloid-negative carriers and co-occurred in 10/30 (33%). INTERPRETATION: ATTRS77Y symptoms commonly occur after age 50, but may begin earlier. Median neuropathy, skin denervation and cardiomyopathy are frequently identified. Symptoms may be absent in patients and common in amyloid-negative carriers.","10.1002/acn3.51741","Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Amyloid; Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial; Cardiomyopathies; Carpal Tunnel Syndrome; Israel; Retrospective Studies; Prealbumin","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

In a subgroup of patients with PGAD/GPD, cauda equina Tarlov cyst-induced sacral radiculopathy has been reported to trigger the disorder. In our evaluation of lumbosacral magnetic resonance images in patients with PGAD/GPD and suspected sacral radiculopathy, some had no Tarlov cysts but showed lumbosacral disc annular tear pathology. AIM: The aims were 2-fold: (1) to utilize a novel multidisciplinary step-care management algorithm designed to identify a subgroup of patients with PGAD/GPD and lumbosacral annular tear-induced sacral radiculopathy who could benefit from lumbar endoscopic spine surgery (LESS) and (2) to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of LESS. METHODS: Clinical data were collected on patients with PGAD/GPD who underwent LESS between 2016 and 2020 with at least 1-year follow-up. LESS was indicated because all had lumbosacral annular tear-induced sacral radiculopathy confirmed by our multidisciplinary management algorithm that included the following: step A, a detailed psychosocial and medical history; step B, noninvasive assessments for sacral radiculopathy; step C, targeted diagnostic transforaminal epidural spinal injections resulting in a temporary, clinically significant reduction of PGAD/GPD symptoms; and step D, surgical intervention with LESS and postoperative follow-up. OUTCOMES: Treatment outcome was based on the validated Patient Global Impression of Improvement, measured at postoperative intervals. RESULTS: Our cohort included 15 cisgendered women and 5 cisgendered men (mean ± SD age, 40.3 ± 16.8 years) with PGAD/GPD who fulfilled the criteria of lumbosacral annular tear-induced sacral radiculopathy based on our multidisciplinary management algorithm. Patients were followed for an average of 20 months (range, 12-37) post-LESS. Lumbosacral annular tear pathology was identified at multiple levels, the most common being L4-L5 and L5-S1. Twenty-two LESS procedures were performed in 20 patients. Overall, 80% (16/20) reported improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement; 65% (13/20) reported improvement as much better or very much better. All patients were discharged the same day. There were no surgical complications. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Among the many recognized triggers for PGAD/GPD, this subgroup exhibited lumbosacral annular tear-induced sacral radiculopathy and experienced long-term alleviation of symptoms by LESS. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Strengths include long-term post-surgical follow-up and demonstration that LESS effectively treats patients with PGAD/GPD who have lumbosacral annular tear-induced sacral radiculopathy, as established by a multidisciplinary step-care management algorithm. Limitations include the small study cohort and the unavailability of a clinical measure specific for PGAD/GPD. CONCLUSION: LESS is safe and effective in treating patients with PGAD/GPD who are diagnosed with lumbosacral annular tear-induced sacral radiculopathy.","10.1093/jsxmed/qdac017","Male; Humans; Female; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged; Radiculopathy; Paresthesia; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Urogenital Diseases; Arousal; Genitalia; Lumbar Vertebrae","lumbar endoscopic spine surgery; magnetic resonance imaging; neurogenital testing; persistent genital arousal disorder; sacral radiculopathy","Journal Article"

The study's objective was to compare symptomatic versus asymptomatic women with X-ALD regarding their physical and mental well-being and quality of life. METHODS: Data were obtained from a prospective, international, cross-sectional cohort study of women with X-ALD recruited both clinically and population based. Symptoms, quality of life, and physical and mental co-morbidities were assessed by questionnaires. Women were considered symptomatic if they reported any sign of myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy. Group differences between symptomatic versus asymptomatic women and between age groups were examined using χ2 tests for categorical and independent sample t tests or analysis of variance for continuous variables. RESULTS: Complete data were available from N = 180 women (mean age: 51.2 ± 13.6 years, range: 18-85), of whom 71.7% were classified as symptomatic, with prevalence increasing with age. Symptomatic versus asymptomatic women reported poorer physical and mental health, with 26.4% meeting the criteria for a clinical depression, 73.6% reporting chronic pain, 80.6% sleeping disturbances, 38.2% sexual dysfunction, and 47.3% restless legs syndrome. Large group differences were found on the physical health, but not on the mental health component of quality of life, where symptomatic women only differed when controlling for having a boy affected by X-ALD (small effect) and treatment frequency (medium effect). CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic women with X-ALD present with physical and psychological co-morbidities significantly reducing individuals' quality of life.

METHOD: 40 pwMS were included in the study, randomized by simple random method and divided into 2 groups. Low-frequency Transkutaneal Electric Stimulation (TENS) was applied to 1st group and Interferential current was applied to 2nd group for 30 min 5 days/a week for 4 weeks. For pain severity Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), for neuropathic pain the LANSS questionnaire was used. Functional capacity was evaluated with the 2-minute walk test (2MWT) and quality of life was evaluated with the 'Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Scale (MusiQol)'. RESULTS: The most severe and mean VAS and LANSS results significiantly decreased, 2MWT results significiantly increased in two groups (p<0.05). A significiant increase was found in all sub-headings of the MusiQol, except for the relationship with the health system in TENS group (p<0.05). An increase was found in the total score, activities of daily living, well-being, relationship with friends, relationship with family, sexual life, rejection sub-headings of the MusiQol in IFC group (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of VAS, LANSS, 2MWT and MusiQol (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: In this study, it was found that interference current and TENS applications decrease pain and increase functional capacity. However, it was determined that TENS application was a more effective method in increasing the quality of life.

To evaluate the frequency and type of them, we described our multidisciplinary approach with preliminary results of the first enrolled patients. METHODS: We included patients aged ≥ 18 years with hospital admission for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms were grouped in five macro groups hereafter referred to as ""Symptoms Category"" (SC): respiratory SC (dyspnoea or cough), neurological SC (peripheral neuropathies, headache, impaired mobility, behavioural disorders), psychological SC (sleep disorders, mood disorders), muscular SC (arthromyalgia, asthenia), other SC (fever, alopecia, diarrhoea, weight loss, smell and taste alterations, sexual dysfunctions). SC were evaluated at discharge and at follow-up. Association between patients' characteristics and presence of SC at follow up was estimated by a logistic multivariable regression model. RESULTS: From June 2020 to July 2021, we followed up 361 patients: 128 (35.5%) who were previously admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 233 patients to ordinary department. The median length of hospital stay was 20 days (Inter-Quartile-Range 13-32). Most patients (317/361, 87.8%) were still symptomatic at discharge, with one third referring three or more SC. At follow up, 67.3% (243/361) of patients still complained at least one SC. Moreover, 159 patients (44%) developed at least one new involved SC during follow up: 116 (72.9%) one SC, 39 (24.5%) two SC, 4 (2.5%) three or more SC. At follow up visit 130 of 361 (36%) were still with SC developed during follow up. At multivariable analysis presence of any SC at follow-up was associated with male gender (Odds Ratio [OR] 3.23, Confidence Interval [CI] 95% 1.46-7.15), ICU admission (OR 2.78, CI 95% 1.29-5.96) and presence of SC at discharge (OR 14.39, CI 95% 6.41-32.32). CONCLUSIONS: In our sample of patients with severe COVID-19, we found that PCC are highly variable and fluctuating over time; in particular, in about 50% of our patients new SC appear during follow up. Moreover, presence of PCC also in patients without SC at discharge and the variability of symptoms underlining the advisability of our multidisciplinary approach.

Cases of its transmission also have been reported via perinatal, sexual and transfusion transmission. ZIKV pathologies include meningo-encephalitis and myelitis in the central nervous system (CNS) and Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute transient polyneuritis in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Drugs like azithromycin have been tested as inhibitors of ZIKV infection but no vaccines or treatments are currently available. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the CNS and among the first cells in CNS infected by ZIKV; (2) Methods: We previously used SOMAScan proteomics to study ZIKV-infected astrocytic cells.

The presence of chronic pain is linked to persistent alterations in the peripheral and the central nervous system. One of the main types of peripheral pain transducers are the transient receptor potential channels (TRP), also known as thermoTRP channels, which intervene in the perception of hot and cold external stimuli. These channels, and especially TRPV1, TRPA1 and TRPM8, have been subjected to profound investigation because of their role as thermosensors and also because of their implication in acute and chronic pain. Surprisingly, their sensitivity to endogenous signaling has been far less studied. Cumulative evidence suggests that the function of these channels may be differently modulated in males and females, in part through sexual hormones, and this could constitute a significant contributor to the sex differences in chronic pain. Here, we review the exciting advances in thermoTRP pharmacology for males and females in two paradigmatic types of chronic pain with a strong peripheral component: chronic migraine and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The possibilities of peripheral druggability offered by these channels and the differential exploitation for men and women represent a development opportunity that will lead to a significant increment of the armamentarium of analgesic medicines for personalized chronic pain treatment.","10.1016/j.pharmthera.2022.108297","Female; Humans; Male; Analgesics; Chronic Pain; Migraine Disorders; Sex Characteristics; Transient Receptor Potential Channels; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Antineoplastic Agents; Thermoreceptors","Allodynia; CGRP; Hormones; Hyperalgesia; Inflammation; Ion channels; Menstrual cycle; Neuropathic; Nociceptors","Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The nerves of the cauda equine provide the muscles that manage the bladder, bowel and the legs and the dysfunction producing impairment of bladder, bowel or sexual function and perianal or saddle numbness. Identification of CES is not only important to neurosurgeons and spine surgeons, but also to prime care practitioners, emergency room physicians, physiotherapists and allied health care professionals concerned in management of back pain. It is a significant diagnosis from a clinical and medico-legal outlook. Early surgical decompression is endorsed by most authors to best support patient's revival and trim down long term disability. This cross sectional observational study was conducted at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospitals, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2015 to January 2021 and the aim of this study was to find the predictors and the clinical outcome of cauda equina syndrome after spinal decompression with delayed presentation. Among 680 patients of degenerative disc diseases; 32 cases (4.7%) had CES, those presenting late in course of disease. Time interval between bladder and bowel dysfunction and admission to hospital varied from 2-64 days with mean delay of 15.4 days. The average follow-up was 22.6 months, ranging from 12 to 34 months. There was significant positive correlation (p<0.05) between duration taken for total recovery and delay in surgery and between delayed decompression and a poor outcome. Also there was a clear correlation between the presence of complete perineal anaesthesia and absence of anal wink as both univariate and multivariate predictors of a poor outcome. There was significant association between a slower onset of CES and a favourable outcome.

In addition, sex differences have been observed in ECS regulation and function. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether administration of oxaliplatin, a neurotoxic antineoplastic agent, induced changes in the expression of ECS components in peripheral and central stations of the pain pathway, and if those changes exhibited sexual dimorphism. Adult male and female rats were injected with oxaliplatin or saline, and mechanical and cold hypersensitivity and allodynia were evaluated using Von Frey and Choi Tests. The mRNA levels corresponding to cannabinoid receptors (CB1, CB2), cannabinoid-related receptors (GPR55, 5HT1A, TRPV1) and to the main enzymes involved in the synthesis (DAGL, DAGL, NAPE-PLD) and degradation (MGL, FAAH) of endocannabinoids were assessed in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and spinal cord by using real time RT-PCR. In addition, the levels of the main endocannabinoids, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), were evaluated using commercial ELISA kits. Oxaliplatin administration induced the development of mechanical and cold hypersensitivity and allodynia in male and female animals. Oxaliplatin also induced early and robust changes in the expression of several components of the ECS in DRGs. A marked upregulation of CB1, CB2, 5HT1A and TRPV1 was detected in both sexes. Interestingly, while DAGL mRNA levels remained unchanged, DAGL was downregulated in male and upregulated in female rats. Finally, MGL and NAPE-PLD showed increased levels only in male animals, while FAAH resulted upregulated in both sexes. In parallel, reduced 2-AG and AEA levels were detected in DRGs from male or female rats, respectively. In the lumbar spinal cord, only TRPV1 mRNA levels were found to be upregulated in both sexes. Our results reveal previously unreported changes in the expression of cannabinoid receptors, ligands and enzymes occurring mainly in the peripheral nervous system and displaying certain sexual dimorphism. These changes may contribute to the physiopathology of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain in male and female rats. A better understanding of these dynamic changes will facilitate the development of mechanism- and sex-specific approaches to optimize the use of cannabinoid-based medicines for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced pain.","10.1016/j.expneurol.2022.114232","Female; Male; Rats; Animals; Endocannabinoids; Sex Characteristics; Hyperalgesia; Oxaliplatin; TRPV Cation Channels; Neuralgia; Receptors, Cannabinoid; Cannabinoids; Antineoplastic Agents; RNA, Messenger; Models, Theoretical; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes","Cannabinoid metabolizing enzymes; Cannabinoid receptors; Changes in endocannabinoid system components; Endocannabinoids; Mechanical and cold hypersensitivity and allodynia; Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathic pain; Sexual dimorphism, dorsal root ganglia; Spinal cord","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

We aimed to investigate this aspect of ALS. [Methods] We held a nationwide webinar, titled ""ALS Café,"" and distributed self-report questionnaires to ALS patients. In addition to the frequency of non-motor symptoms such as fatigue, pain, sleep disorders, defecation disorders, sialorrhea, and sexual problems, we evaluated the quality of life (QoL), ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). [Results] The average age of the 33 respondents (19 male, 14 female) was 60.8 ± 11.2; 96.7% of respondents had some non-motor symptoms. The median ALSFRS-R was 32.0, and seven (21.2%) of the respondents had a PHQ-9 score of 10 or higher. Fatigue was the most common non-motor symptom (81.8%), followed by pain (60.6%), defecation disorders (57.6%), sleep disorders (48.5%), sialorrhea (48.5%), and sexual problems (24.2%). Fatigue was more frequent in females (P = 0.03). Among the non-motor symptoms, pain was the most common factor affecting QoL, followed by fatigue. More than 90% of ALS patients answered that they had never consulted a physician/counselor about sexual problems. Patients with pain had higher PHQ-9 scores than those without (P = 0.01). There was no correlation between the ALSFRS-R score and QoL and PHQ-9. [Conclusions] Most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis had non-motor symptoms, and fatigue and pain were the most common. We showed that many non-motor symptoms affected QoL without correlating with ALSFRS-R score. Attention should be paid to those even if the motor symptoms of ALS are mild.","10.1007/s13760-022-02036-6","Humans; Male; Female; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Quality of Life; Sialorrhea; Pain; Sleep Wake Disorders; Fatigue","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Fatigue; Non-motor symptoms; Pain; Quality of life","Journal Article"

Patients report willingness to trade potential recovery of strength, bowel, bladder, or sexual function for pain relief. One proposed mechanism causing NP is up-regulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) proteins in uninjured C fibers and dorsal root ganglia causing neuronal excitability. Recent studies have found up-regulation of TRPV 1 proteins after SCI. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize the application of capsaicin 8% patch (C8P), FDA approved for NP in diabetic peripheral neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia, will improve pain, function and QOL in persons with SCI. METHODS: Randomized single-blind crossover design in which 11 persons with SCI and NP refractory to two oral pain medications received C8P or a control low dose Capsaicin 0.025% patch (CON) over two 12-week periods. Pain (VAS, MPI-SCI), quality of life (WHO-QOL), and functional status (SCIM) were measured at 2-4-week intervals. RESULTS: There was a main treatment effect of C8P over CON on VAS and MPI-SCI outcomes with pain reduction of 35% and 29% at weeks 2 and 4, respectively. C8P also demonstrated a main treatment effect over CON on the SCIM mobility subscale. WHO-QOL scores did not improve with C8P. CONCLUSIONS: C8P improves pain and mobility for patients with SCI and refractory NP.

Animal models are essential for preclinical evaluation of novel diagnostic procedures and treatment strategies. Gene targeting/editing offers the possibility of developing tailored pig models for monogenic diseases. The first porcine DMD model was generated by deletion of DMD exon 52 (DMDΔ52) in cultured kidney cells, which were used for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce DMDΔ52 offspring. The animals resembled clinical, biochemical, and pathological hallmarks of DMD, but died before sexual maturity, thus preventing their propagation by breeding. This limitation was overcome by the generation of female heterozygous DMDΔ52 carrier pigs, which allowed the establishment of a large breeding colony. In this overview, we summarize how porcine DMD models have been used for dissecting disease mechanisms, for validating multispectral optoacoustic tomography as an imaging modality for monitoring fibrosis, and for preclinical testing of a CRISPR/Cas9 based approach to restore an intact DMD reading frame. Particular advantages of porcine DMD models include their targeted design and the rapid disease progression with early cardiac involvement, facilitating translational studies in reasonable time frames.","10.1016/j.nmd.2022.04.005","Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Disease Models, Animal; Dystrophin; Exons; Female; Gene Editing; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Swine","Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Gene editing; Optoacoustic imaging; Pig model","Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) has been proven to promote nerve repair. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect and potential mechanism of ALCAR in the treatment of NED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two rats were randomly divided into bilateral CN injury (BCNI) group, BCNI + lower-dose ALCAR (50 mg/kg/day) group, BCNI + higher-dose (100 mg/kg/day) group, and sham-operated group. Erectile function was assessed 14 days after daily intraperitoneal injection of ALCAR or placebo. The penile tissues were gathered for subsequent histological and molecular biological analysis. Rat Schwann cell (SC) line S16 was used to verify the mechanism of ALCAR in vitro. RESULTS: We found that the erectile function of the rats in the BCNI group was severely impaired, which was improved considerably in both BCNI+ALCAR-LD and BCNI+ALCAR-HD groups. Also, we observed decreased smooth muscle and increased collagen content in the corpus cavernosum in the BCNI group. The expressions of fibrosis markers transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and Smad 2/3 were significantly up-regulated in the BCNI group. The above changes were alleviated after the administration of lower and higher-dose ALCAR. Meanwhile, the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway (cGMP) was promoted and the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA)/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway was inhibited in the corpus cavernosum of BCNI rats after ALCAR treatment, accompanied by increased neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and down-regulated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). In vitro, ALCAR promoted the migration and proliferation of SC and increased the expression of 22-kD peripheral myelin protein and nerve growth factor (NGF). Further, rats treated with ALCAR had high expression of ATF3 and S100 in the distal nerve tissues of the CN extrusion site. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: ALCAR could promote nerve repair and regeneration, inhibit penile fibrosis, and improve penile erection by promoting the proliferation and migration of SC and the secretion of NGF. Our study confirms that ALCAR may be a potential treatment strategy for NED.","10.1111/andr.13187","Acetylcarnitine; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Fibrosis; Humans; Male; Nerve Growth Factor; Nerve Regeneration; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Schwann cell; acetyl-L-carnitine; bilateral cavernous nerve injury; fibrosis; neurogenic erectile dysfunction","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Evidence from animal models suggests an axonopathy of peripheral A- and C-type fibres that affects their excitability. However, direct effects of paclitaxel on sensory neuron excitability and sexual dimorphism remain poorly understood. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used a long-lasting (10 days in vitro) primary culture of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to investigate the time course effect of paclitaxel on the electrical activity of IB4(-) and IB4(+) sensory neurons of female and male adult Wistar rats. KEY RESULTS: Paclitaxel strongly and reversibly stimulated spontaneous activity and augmented action potential tonic firing in IB4(-) and IB4(+) neurons in both sexes, peaking at 48 h post-treatment and virtually disappearing at 96 h. Paclitaxel decreased the current rheobase for action potential firing by reducing and accelerating the after-hyperpolarization phase. Molecularly, paclitaxel modulated Na+ and K+ ion currents. Particularly, the drug significantly augmented the function of Nav 1.8, TRPV1 and TRPM8 channels. Furthermore, paclitaxel increased Nav 1.8 and TRPV1 expression at 48 h post-treatment. Notably, we observed that female DRG neurons appear more sensitive to paclitaxel sensitization than their male counterparts. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our data indicate that paclitaxel similarly potentiated IB4(-) and IB4(+) electrogenicity and uncover a potential sex dimorphism in paclitaxel-induced chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Our in vitro, pre-clinical, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy paradigm provides a tool for studying the dynamics and underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to nociceptor sensitization in peripheral neuropathies and for testing desensitizing compounds.","10.1111/bph.15809","Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Female; Ganglia, Spinal; Humans; Male; Paclitaxel; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rats, Wistar; Sensory Receptor Cells","cancer; ion channel; neuropathy; nociceptor; pain; sexual dimorphism; thermoTRP","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

METHODS: Fifty male SD rats were randomly divided into five groups of an equal number: sham operation, BCNI model control, and low-, medium- and high-dose HJ-1. The BCNI model was made in the latter four groups by clamping the bilateral cavernous nerves with hemostatic forceps. Three days after modeling, the rats in the sham operation and BCNI model control groups were treated intragastrically with pure water and those in the low-, medium- and high-dose HJ-1 groups with HJ-1 at 2.835, 5.67 and 11.34 g/kg/d, respectively, all for 28 successive days. Then, the animals were subjected to intracavernous pressure (ICP) measurement for evaluation of their erectile function and immunofluorescence staining and Western blot for determination of the Cx43 level in the penile tissue. RESULTS: The BCNI model controls, compared with the rats in the sham operation group, showed a dramatically decreased ratio of maximum ICP to mean arterial pressure (mICP/MAP) (0.40 ± 0.04 vs 0.83 ± 0.10, P < 0.01) and that of total ICP to MAP (tICP/MAP) (21.89 ± 2.16 vs 50.27 ± 4.45, P < 0.01), as well as a down-regulated expression of Cx43 in the penile tissue (P < 0.01).

METHODS: A systematic review was performed using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to characterize post-related complications following hip arthroscopy for central or peripheral compartment hip pathology, including femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and chondrolabral injury. Inclusion criteria were prospective and retrospective Level I-IV evidence investigations that reported results of hip arthroscopy performed in the supine position. Exclusion criteria included open or extra-articular endoscopic hip surgery. Post-related complications included pudendal nerve injury (sexual dysfunction, dyspareunia, perineal pain or numbness) or perineum/external genitalia soft-tissue injury. RESULTS: Ninety-four studies (12,212 hips; 49% male, 51% female; 52% Level IV evidence) were analyzed. Prospective studies (3,032 hips) report a greater incidence of post-related complications compared with retrospective (8,116 hips) studies (7.1% vs 1.4%, P < .001). Three studies (1,064 hips) used a postless technique and all reported a 0% incidence of pudendal neurapraxia or perineal soft tissue injury. Most pudendal nerve complications were transient, resolving by 3 months, but permanent nerve injury was reported in 4 cases.

"34745123","Hide and Seek: The Interplay Between Zika Virus and the Host Immune Response.","Lee LJ; Komarasamy TV; Adnan NAA; James W; Rmt Balasubramaniam V","Frontiers in immunology","2021","Zika virus (ZIKV) received worldwide attention over the past decade when outbreaks of the disease were found to be associated with severe neurological syndromes and congenital abnormalities. Unlike most other flaviviruses, ZIKV can spread through sexual and transplacental transmission, adding to the complexity of Zika pathogenesis and clinical outcomes. In addition, the spread of ZIKV in flavivirus-endemic regions, and the high degree of structural and sequence homology between Zika and its close cousin Dengue have raised questions on the interplay between ZIKV and the pre-existing immunity to other flaviviruses and the potential immunopathogenesis. The Zika epidemic peaked in 2016 and has affected over 80 countries worldwide. The re-emergence of large-scale outbreaks in the future is certainly a possibility. To date, there has been no approved antiviral or vaccine against the ZIKV. Therefore, continuing Zika research and developing an effective antiviral and vaccine is essential to prepare the world for a future Zika epidemic. For this purpose, an in-depth understanding of ZIKV interaction with many different pathways in the human host and how it exploits the host immune response is required. For successful infection, the virus has developed elaborate mechanisms to escape the host response, including blocking host interferon response and shutdown of certain host cell translation. This review provides a summary on the key host factors that facilitate ZIKV entry and replication and the mechanisms by which ZIKV antagonizes antiviral innate immune response and involvement of adaptive immune response leading to immunopathology. We also discuss how ZIKV modulates the host immune response during sexual transmission and pregnancy to induce infection, how the cross-reactive immunity from other flaviviruses impacts ZIKV infection, and provide an update on the current status of ZIKV vaccine development.","10.3389/fimmu.2021.750365","Adaptive Immunity; Animals; Autoimmunity; Cross Reactions; Female; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Pregnancy; Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Zika virus; congenital abnormalities; cross-reactive immunity; immunopathogenesis; innate and adaptive immunity; pregnancy; sexual transmission; vaccine","Journal Article; Review"

With an increasing number of procedures being performed on the labia, it is important to elucidate the route and note any variation from normal of the nerve. METHODS: Fifty-one cadavers were dissected to yield 97 dorsal nerve of the clitoris samples. Measurements were taken from (1) the dorsal nerve of the clitoris penetration point of the perineal membrane to the urethra, (2) the nerve's penetration point of the perineal membrane to the pubic bone, (3) the angle of the clitoris to the branch point of the dorsal nerve of the clitoris, and (4) the branch point of the nerve to the distalmost point of the glans clitoris. Any anomalous branching patterns of the dorsal nerve of the clitoris were recorded and classified. RESULTS: The means and standard deviations of each measurement were used to create a surgical danger zone. The mean of each measurement was (1) 34.63 mm, (2) 5.74 mm, (3) -3.07 mm, and (4) 30.40 mm, respectively. In addition, six distinct branching patterns were observed, organized, and classified based on the location and number of branches observed. CONCLUSIONS: The dorsal nerve of the clitoris has multiple branching patterns and typically travels along the same course in most women. Further investigation of the course and three-dimensional position of the dorsal nerve of the clitoris is warranted to preserve sexual sensation as the frequency of procedures involving the female pudendum increases.","10.1097/PRS.0000000000008412","Anatomic Variation; Cadaver; Clitoris; Female; Gynecologic Surgical Procedures; Humans; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Pleasure; Pudendal Nerve","","Journal Article"

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in the electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Ovid. Data regarding outcome parameters from eligible studies were extracted. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of 852 patients (492 males and 360 females), with a mean age of 44.6 ± 5.5 years from 22 studies diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome and undergoing surgical decompression, were included in the meta-analysis; however, not all studies reported every outcome. The mean follow-up period was 39.2 months, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months in all included studies. Meta-analysis showed that on long-term follow-up, 43.3% [29.1, 57.5] (n=708) of patients had persistent bladder dysfunction. Persistent bowel dysfunction was observed in 31.1% [14.7, 47.6] (n=439) cases, sensory deficit in 53.3% [37.1, 69.6] (n=519), motor weakness in 38.4% [22.4, 54.4] (n=490), and sexual dysfunction in 40.1% [28.0, 52.1] (n=411). Decompression within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms was associated with a favourable outcome in terms of bladder function with 24.6% [1.6, 50.9] (n=75) patients having persistent dysfunction, whereas 50.3% [10.3, 90.4] (n=185) of patients in studies with a mean time to decompression after 48 hours had persistent bladder dysfunction. Other factors such as speed of onset and sex of the patients were not found to significantly impact long-term bladder outcomes. CONCLUSION: The long-term outcomes of CES after decompression are enumerated. Decompression within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms appears to result in fewer patients with persistent bladder dysfunction. However, a randomized controlled trial is required to conclusively determine whether early decompression leads to better outcomes.","10.1007/s00586-021-07001-0","Adult; Cauda Equina; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Decompression, Surgical; Female; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Middle Aged; Polyradiculopathy; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Urinary Bladder","Cauda equina syndrome; Meta-analysis; Prognosis; Systematic review","Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Review"

Findings from the validation study suggested that the two MSQOL-54 composite scores are correlated. Given this correlation, it could be assumed that a unique total score of HRQOL may be calculated, with the advantage to provide key stakeholders with a single overall HRQOL score. We aimed to assess how well the bifactor model could account for the MSQOL-54 structure, in order to verify whether a total HRQOL score can be calculated. METHODS: A large international database (3669 MS patients) was used. By means of confirmatory factor analysis, we estimated a bifactor model in which every item loads onto both a general factor and a group factor. Fit of the bifactor model was compared to that of single and two second-order factor models by means of Akaike information and Bayesian information criteria reduction. Reliability of the total and subscale scores was evaluated with Mc Donald's coefficients (omega, and omega hierarchical). RESULTS: The bifactor model outperformed the two second-order factor models in all the statistics. All items loaded satisfactorily (≥ 0.40) on the general HRQOL factor, except the sexual function items. Omega coefficients for total score were very satisfactory (0.98 and 0.87). Omega hierarchical for subscales ranged between 0.22 to 0.57, except for the sexual function (0.70). CONCLUSIONS: The bifactor model is particularly useful when it is intended to acknowledge multidimensionality and at the same time take account of a single general construct, as the HRQOL related to MS. The total raw score can be used as an estimate of the general HRQOL latent score.","10.1186/s12955-021-01857-y","Bayes Theorem; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humans; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Multiple Sclerosis; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires","Bifactor model; Dimensionality; Factor analyses; Health-related quality of life; MSQOL-54; Multiple sclerosis","Journal Article"

METHODS: A model of neurogenic erectile dysfunction was performed using bilateral cavernous nerve crush injury in rats. ADSCs suspensions (1 × 106/0.2 ml), were administered via intracavernous injection (ICI) after being allowed to shelve for 0 minute (ICI 0) or 60 minutes (ICI 60) in vitro, as well as cell aggregates isolated from ICI 60 (ICI A). The caudal vein injection group (CVI 60) was used to evaluate whether cell self-aggregation was beneficial to EF when introduced into the peripheral circulation. One day after the transplantation, the distribution of cells was observed. EF and histopathological changes were evaluated after 4 weeks. RESULTS: Approximately 85% of ADSCs self-aggregated into cell clusters at 60 minutes. The ICI 60 had more significant improvements in EF and more visualized ADSCs retained in the corpus cavernosum (CC) than ICI 0 and CVI 60 (P <.05), but no significant difference between ICI 60 and ICI A. In the CVI 60 group, the cell clusters formed by self-aggregation could hardly reach the CC and were mostly found in lung tissue. Immunofluorescence staining showed increased the content of expressing biomarkers of smooth muscle, nerve within the CC tissue in the ICI groups when compared to the CVI group. CONCLUSION: ADSCs self-aggregation before ICI may be an influential factor in the treatment of neurogenic erectile dysfunction. Its potential mechanism may be through improving cell retention in the CC.","10.1016/j.urology.2021.09.002","Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cell Aggregation; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Injections, Intravenous; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Muscle, Smooth; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Peripheral Nerves; Rats","","Journal Article"

CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old Sinhalese woman presented with a vulval abscess, with a history of involuntary leakage of urine for the last 7 years. Her sexual activity has been compromised due to coital incontinence, and she had also been treated for recurrent urinary tract infections during the last 7 years. On examination, a distended bladder was found. Neurological examination revealed a saddle sensory loss of S2-S4 dermatomes. There was no sensory loss over the lower limbs. Bladder sensation was absent, but there was some degree of anal sphincter tone. Motor functions and reflexes were normal in the limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed L5-S1 spondylolisthesis. Ultrasound imaging confirmed the finding of a distended bladder, in addition to bilateral hydroureters with hydronephrosis. An incision and drainage with concomitant intravenous antibiotics were started for the vulval abscess. An indwelling catheter was placed to decompress the bladder and to reduce vulval excoriations due to urine. Bilateral ureteric stenting was performed later for persistent hydronephrosis and hydroureter despite an empty bladder. CONCLUSION: This is a tragic case that illustrates the devastating long-term sequelae that ensues if cauda equina syndrome is left undiagnosed. It reiterates the importance of prompt referral and surgical decompression.","10.1186/s13256-021-03012-z","Abscess; Cauda Equina; Decompression, Surgical; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Polyradiculopathy","Bilateral sciatica; Cauda equina syndrome; Perineal hypoesthesia; Saddle sensory loss; Urinary retention; Vulval abscess","Case Reports; Journal Article"

Knowledge regarding pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the etiology and production of symptoms in PVD remains incomplete but is considered multifactorial. Using a cross-sectional observational study design, data from untargeted metabolomic profiling of vaginal fluid and plasma in women with PVD and healthy women was combined with pain testing and brain imaging in women with PVD to test the hypotheses that women with PVD compared to healthy women show differences in vaginal and plasma metabolites involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis. Steroid hormone metabolites showing group differences were correlated with vulvar vestibular pain and vaginal muscle tenderness and functional connectivity of brain regions involved in pain processing in women with PVD to provide insight into the functional mechanisms linked to the identified alterations. Sensitivity analyses were also performed to determine the impact of hormonal contraceptive use on the study findings. Women with PVD compared to healthy controls had significant reductions primarily in vaginal fluid concentrations of androgenic, pregnenolone and progestin metabolites involved in steroidogenesis, suggesting localized rather than systemic effects in vagina and vulvar vestibule. The observed reductions in androgenic metabolite levels showed large effect size associations with increased vulvar vestibular pain and vulvar muscle tenderness and decreases in androgenic and progestin metabolites were associated with decreased connectivity strength in primary sensorimotor cortices. Women with PVD showed symptom-associated reductions in vaginal fluid concentrations of metabolites involved in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones previously shown to affect the integrity of vulvar and vaginal tissue and nociceptive processing. Deficiency of certain steroids may be an important mechanism contributing to the pathophysiology of symptoms in PVD may provide potential diagnostic markers that could lead to new targets for therapeutic intervention.","10.1177/17448069211041853","Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Myalgia; Pain Measurement; Sensorimotor Cortex; Vagina; Vulvodynia; Young Adult","Dyspareunia; metabolomics; pain; provoked vestibulodynia; steroid hormone biosynthesis vaginal metabolites; vulvodynia","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

This study is aimed at investigating how patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals (occupational therapists and physiotherapists) experience the assistive device situation. METHODS: Twenty-four interviews were conducted with patients with motor neuron disease, caregivers, and healthcare professionals involved in procurement and adaptation of assistive devices. Systematic text condensation was used to analyse the interviews. RESULTS: The majority of patients and caregivers had positive experiences of follow-up by the specialist healthcare service. Several found follow-up by the primary health service to be deficient owing to inadequate expertise, continuity, and resources. Healthcare professionals reported having a proactive approach to identifying needs for assistive devices, but for various reasons, application processes were often delayed. Several patients indicated a reluctance to use assistive devices and were ambivalent regarding proactivity. The availability of assistive devices for some functional impairments was described as inadequate. Some patients felt there was too little focus on sexuality in the follow-up. The respondents had a number of suggestions for improving the assistive device situation. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary ALS teams are found to ensure follow-up expertise and continuity. Healthcare professionals wish to take a proactive approach to assistive devices, but a number of bureaucratic obstacles occur. The study findings are preliminary and should be validated through a prospective national quality registry for motor neuron diseases.","10.1155/2021/5563343","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Caregivers; Humans; Occupational Therapy; Prospective Studies; Self-Help Devices","","Journal Article"

The primary goal is to help patients suffering from chronic or acute pelvic pain coupled with functional disorders like dysuria, urgency, dyspareunia, mobility disorders orhypoesthesia. Neurogenic defects are not the most common etiology for either of listed symptoms. However, after exclusion of the more common ones and failure to respond to basic therapeutic methods such as physiotherapy or analgotheraphy doctors tend to mark the illness as idiopathic and incurable.

METHODS: Review of literature using databases Pubmed, Science direct, Medline and sources of the international school of neuropelveology. CONCLUSION: Over a lifetime, one in seven women will suffer from chronic pelvic pain. Outside of the cases where a clear postoperative etiology is established, the time to make a correct dia-gnosis is often long for the unspecific and varied symptomatology. Neuropelveological dia-gnostic algorithm is demonstrably efficient in shortening the time to dia-gnosis and more importantly to the treatment.","10.48095/cccg2021279","Chronic Pain; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Neuralgia; Pelvic Pain; Pelvis","chronic pelvic pain; decompression and neurolysis; neuropelveology; pelvic congestion syndromes; pudendal neuralgia","Journal Article; Review"

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by sexual dimorphism, showing sex-specific trends in site of onset, phenotypes, and prognosis. Here, we explored resting state (RS) FC differences within major large-scale functional networks between women and men in a sample of ALS patients, in comparison to healthy controls (HCs). A group-level independent component analysis (ICA) was performed on RS-fMRI time-series enabling spatial and spectral analyses of large-scale RS FC networks in 45 patients with ALS (20 F; 25 M) and 31 HCs (15 F; 16 M) with a focus on sex-related differences. A whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was also performed to highlight atrophy differences. Between-sex comparisons showed: decreased FC in the right middle frontal gyrus and in the precuneus within the default mode network (DMN), in affected men compared to affected women; decreased FC in the right post-central gyrus (sensorimotor network), in the right inferior parietal gyrus (right fronto-parietal network) and increased FC in the anterior cingulate cortex and right insula (salience network), in both affected and non-affected men compared to women. When comparing affected men to affected women, VBM analysis revealed atrophy in men in the right lateral occipital cortex. Our results suggest that in ALS sex-related trends of brain functional and structural changes are more heavily represented in DMN and in the occipital cortex, suggesting that sex is an additional dimension of functional and structural heterogeneity in ALS.","10.1007/s00702-021-02413-0","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Brain networks; Functional connectivity; Resting-state functional MRI; Sex","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

This study assesses the recently defined core outcome set for CES in a cohort of patients using validated questionnaires. METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2019, 82 patients underwent surgical decompression for acute CES secondary to massive lumbar disc prolapse at our hospital. After review of their records, patients were included if they presented with the clinical and radiological features of CES, then classified as CES incomplete (CESI) or with painless urinary retention (CESR) in accordance with guidelines published by the British Association of Spinal Surgeons. Patients provided written consent and completed a series of questionnaires. RESULTS: In total, 61 of 82 patients returned a completed survey. Their mean age at presentation was 43 years (20 to 77; SD 12.7), and the mean duration of follow-up 58.2 months (11 to 182; SD 45.3). Autonomic dysfunction was frequent: 33% of patients reported bladder dysfunction, and 10% required a urinary catheter. There was a 38% and 53% incidence of bowel and sexual dysfunction, respectively: 47% of patients reported genital numbness. A total of 67% reported significant back pain: 44% required further investigation and 10% further intervention for the management of lower back pain. Quality of life was lower than expected when corrected for age and sex. Half the patients reported moderate or worse depression, and 40% of patients of working age could no longer work due to problems attributable to CES. Urinary and faecal incontinence, catheter use, sexual dysfunction, and genital numbness were significantly more common in patients with CESR. CONCLUSION: This study reports the long-term outcome of patients with CES and is the first to use validated patient-reported outcome measures to assess the CES Core Outcome Set.

Nevertheless, the role of circRNAs in cavernous nerve-damaging ED (CNI-ED) is unknown. Here, we aimed to discover novel circRNAs, probed their potential role in the CNI-ED, and construct a ceRNA network of circRNAs. Twelve male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups by us: bilateral cavernous nerve crush (BCNC) and control groups. Four weeks after surgery, the spongy smooth muscle tissue of the rat penis was sequenced using high-throughput full transcriptome sequencing. We analyzed the expression of circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in the two groups. Twenty circRNAs with significantly different expressions were selected for RT-qPCR. CeRNA network of circRNAs was established using Cytoscape. GO and KEGG analysis was done by R package. Sequencing showed that 4,587 circRNAs, 762 miRNAs, and 21,661 mRNAs were dysregulated in the BCNC group. The top 20 differentially expressed circRNAs were further verified via RT-qPCR. The ceRNA network contained ten circRNAs, six miRNAs, and 227 mRNAs, including 23 circRNA-miRNA pairs and 227 miRNA-mRNA pairs. GO and KEGG analysis suggested that these ten circRNAs could main regulate energy metabolism processes. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed with the mRNAs in ceRNA network, and five hub genes were identified. Our study revealed a potential link between circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in CNI-ED, suggesting that circRNAs may contribute to the occurrence of ED by regulating the cellular energy metabolism in CNI-ED.","10.1080/21655979.2021.1973863","Animals; Computational Biology; Energy Metabolism; Erectile Dysfunction; Male; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; RNA, Circular; RNA, Messenger; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Transcriptome","Erectile dysfunction; bioinformatics analysis; ceRNA network; circular RNA; energy metabolism","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The symptoms of post orgasmic illness syndrome last about 2-7 days after an ejaculation. The current hypothesis proposes that the primary injury in post orgasmic illness syndrome is an acute compression proprioceptive axonopathy in the muscle spindle, as is suspected in delayed onset muscle soreness. The terminal arbor degeneration-like lesion of delayed onset muscle soreness is theorized to be an acute stress response energy-depleted dysfunctional mitochondria-induced impairment of Piezo2 channels and glutamate vesicular release. The recurring symptoms of post orgasmic illness syndrome after each ejaculation are suggested to be analogous to the repeated bout effect of delayed onset muscle soreness. However, there are differences in the pathomechanism, mostly attributed to the extent of secondary tissue damage and to the extent of spermidine depletion. The spermidine depletion-induced differences are as follows: modulation of the acute stress response, flu-like symptoms, opioid-like withdrawal and enhanced deregulation of the autonomic nervous system. The longitudinal dimension of delayed onset muscle soreness, in the form of post orgasmic illness syndrome and the repeated bout effect, have cognitive and memory consequences, since the primary injury is learning and memory-related.","10.3390/cells10081867","Animals; Ejaculation; Humans; Ion Channels; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Spindles; Muscle, Skeletal; Myalgia; Orgasm; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Proprioception; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Receptors, Opioid; Spermidine; Stress, Physiological; Syndrome; Time Factors","Piezo 2 ion channel; acute compression proprioceptive axonopathy; delayed onset muscle soreness; muscle spindle; post orgasmic illness syndrome; repeated bout effect","Journal Article"

There is scarce literature regarding the long-term assessment of CES symptoms, and rarer still is the impact of these symptoms on mental wellbeing investigated. This study assessed the long-term patient reported mental wellbeing outcomes of post-operative CES patients. METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery for CES between August 2013 and November 2014 were identified using an ethically approved database. They then completed validated questionnaires over the telephone assessing their mental and physical functioning (Short-Form 12 Questionnaire), generating the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Bladder, bowel and sexual function were also assessed using validated questionnaires. MCS scores were compared to both the Scottish mean and previously published cut-offs indicating patients at risk of depression. Correlations of MCS with bladder, bowel, sexual and physical dysfunction were examined and multifactorial regression to predict MCS from these variables analysed. Independent t-tests assessed the mean difference in MCS between patients presenting with incomplete CES (CES-I) and CES with retention (CES-R) and between those with radiologically confirmed and impending CES. RESULTS: Forty-six participants with a mean follow-up time of 43 months completed the study. The mean (±SD) MCS was 49 (±11.8) with 22% demonstrating poor mental health related quality of life in comparison to the Scottish mean. Overall, 37% had scores consistent with being at risk for depression with in the last 30 days, and 45% within the last 12 months. MCS was significantly correlated with Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) score (-0.608), NBDS score (-0.556), ASEX score (-0.349) and PCS score (0.413) with worse bladder, bowel, sexual and physical dysfunction associated with worse MCS score. Multifactorial regression analysis demonstrated both urinary (USP score p = 0.031) and bowel function (NBDS score p = 0.009) to be significant predictive variables of mental health related quality of life. There were no significant mean differences in MCS between those presenting with CES-I and CES-R or those with radiologically complete and impending CES. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a high frequency of being at risk for depression in patients with CES and identifies outcome measures (physical, sexual and more so bladder and bowel dysfunction) associated with poorer mental wellbeing. Our large cohort and long follow-up highlight that CES patients should be considered at risk of depression, and the need to consider mental health outcomes following CES surgery.","10.1371/journal.pone.0255530","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; Urination Disorders; Young Adult","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a common condition, but the association between SD and MG remains poorly understood. METHODS: An observational study was conducted to explore SD incidence and risk factors in MG patients. The study enrolled 158 MG patients and 161 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. SD was investigated using the Female Sexual Function Inventory (FSFI), the abridged International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), and the Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation-5 (CIPE-5). The mental health was evaluated using Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). RESULTS: A total of 52 male patients and 106 female patients were finally included. The average age of these patients was 41.82 ± 10.44 years. The incidence of female SD was significantly higher in MG patients (48.11%) than in healthy people (22.64%) (P < 0.001). The incidence of SD in male MG patients was also higher. Age and depression were significantly correlated with decreased libido, wakefulness, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction scores, indicating that these are risk factors for SD.

Because the symptoms of KD are similar to most neuromuscular diseases, it is difficult to make a rapid clinical diagnosis. Patient case: We report the case of a 50-year-old man who was diagnosed with ""lumbar disc herniation"" five years ago because of progressive proximal limb weakness. After his initial diagnosis, his condition worsened gradually, and a muscle biopsy was performed 3 years ago, and he was then diagnosed with ""motor neuron disease"", but he had no such family history. His physical examination showed female breast development, erectile dysfunction, a weakness of the quadriceps femoris, a bilateral tendon reflex, and atrophy of the tongue muscle. One year ago, it was found that his blood sugar had increased, and when oral hypoglycemic drugs were given, his blood glucose control was not ideal. At the same time, it was found that his creatine kinase continued to increase significantly. He was admitted to the hospital again because of the aggravation of his walking difficulties. Diagnosis: A laboratory examination showed elevated creatine kinase, an impaired glucose tolerance, and abnormal lactate values. The diagnosis was confirmed using a genetic analysis, which showed a repeated amplification of CAG in the androgen receptor gene. Intervention measures and results: After this diagnosis, the patient had a good prognosis after receiving symptomatic treatment. Lesson: Genetic testing is the key to the diagnosis of KD. Clinicians should make a differential diagnosis, an early diagnosis, and provide treatment as soon as possible according to the patient's clinical manifestations and laboratory examination.",NA,"","Case report; Kennedy’s disease; genetic analysis","Case Reports; Journal Article"

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to identify prognosis factors for favorable functional recovery after CES. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CES is a neurologic impairment of variable symptoms associating urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunctions with or without motor or sensitive deficits caused by nerve root compression of the cauda equina. The definition of CES remains debated, as well as the prognosis factors for favorable functional recovery and the benefit of early surgery. METHODS: One hundred forty patients were included between January 2010 and 2019. Univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazard regression models were conducted. RESULTS: The patients were young with a median age of 46.8 years (range 18-86 yrs). At presentation, 60% were affected by a motor deficit, 42.8% a sensitive deficit, 70% urinary dysfunctions, and 44% bowel dysfunctions. The mean follow-up was 15.5 months. Bilateral motor deficit (P = 0.017) and an initial deficit severity of 0 to 2 (P = 0.001) represented prognosis factors of poor motor recovery. Initial anal incontinence (P = 0.007) was associated with poor bowel recovery. Only 32.8% of the patients went back to work. Initial motor deficit (P = 0.015), motor sequelae (P = 0.001), sphincter dysfunctions sequelae (P = 0.02), and long LOS (P = 0.02) were poor return-to-work prognosis factors. Time to surgery within an early timing < 24 or 48 hours or later did not represent a prognosis factor of recovery in CES. Incomplete versus complete CES did not show better recovery. CONCLUSION: CES remains a profound disabling syndrome with poor functional prognosis: in the long run, few patients go back to work. The main prognosis factors established in our series regarded the initial severity of deficits whether motor or sphincteral. Early or later surgical cauda equina decompression did not show to represent a prognosis factor for functional recovery.Level of Evidence: 4.","10.1097/BRS.0000000000004170","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cauda Equina; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Decompression, Surgical; Humans; Middle Aged; Polyradiculopathy; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

A case report and review of the literature.","Tolkovsky A; Kipervasser S; Fainmesser Y; Alcalay Y; Gadoth A","Journal of neuroimmunology","2021","Background Paraneoplastic motor neuron disease (PMND) is a rare, non-classical form of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS). Anti-Hu and anti-CV2/CRMP5 PNS are mostly associated with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and consist of highly variable clinical syndromes, including sensory neuronopathy, cerebellar ataxia and/or limbic encephalitis. However, substantial motor impairment is uncommon, particularly when no sensory dysfunction co-exists. Case A 72-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was referred to our department of neurology for evaluation. The patient sub-acutely developed progressive neurological dysfunction including erectile dysfunction, behavioral changes, limb weakness, dysphagia, anorexia, as well as worsening stridor that necessitated tracheostomy due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis (BVCP). Neurological examination revealed motor weakness of upper and lower motor neuron origin with autonomic and cognitive dysfunction. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated pleocytosis, elevated protein, presence of oligoclonal bands (OCB), and neuronal antibody testing was positive for anti-Hu and anti-CV2/CRMP5. Based on these findings a diagnosis of a PNS was made. Evaluation for malignancy was negative, and immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatment was initiated but had little effect during fifteen months of follow-up. Conclusions Although PMND is very rare, in an atypical presentation, especially with features that are not usually present in ALS such as autonomic dysfunction, sensory disturbance or cognitive decline, this etiology should be in the differential diagnosis.","10.1016/j.jneuroim.2021.577635","Aged; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Diagnostic Errors; Humans; Male; Paraneoplastic Syndromes, Nervous System","Autoimmune neurology; Bilateral vocal cord paralysis (BVCP); Motor neuron disease; Paraneoplastic syndrome","Case Reports; Journal Article; Review"

Myotonic dystrophy is characterized by a highly variable phenotype that includes muscle weakness and myotonia, and the disorder may affect the function of many endocrine glands. DMPK mRNA is expressed in muscle, testis, liver, pituitary, thyroid, and bone; the mutated form leads to disruption of meiosis and an increase in fetal insulin receptor-A relative to adult insulin receptor-B, resulting in adult primary testicular failure and insulin resistance predisposing to diabetes, respectively. Patients with myotonic dystrophy are also at increased risk for hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, erectile dysfunction, benign and malignant thyroid nodules, bone fractures, miscarriage, preterm delivery, and failed labor during delivery. Circulating parathyroid hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels may be elevated, but the mechanisms for these associations are unclear.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect and possible mechanism of action of YS-10, a new flavonoid compound, which was designed and synthesized based on the structure of ICA II in a rat model in of cavernous nerve injury. MATERIALS/METHODS: Eight of 32 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were selected as the normal control (NC) group and received vehicle treatment. The remaining rats were subjected to bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI) and randomized into three groups: BCNI group, BCNI + ICA II group (2.5 mg/kg/day), and BCNI + YS-10 group (2.5 mg/kg/day). The total procedure lasted for 21 days, followed by a washout period of 3 days. All animals were evaluated for erectile function, and tissues were harvested for histopathological analyses. RESULTS: It was observed that in YS-10 group, the ratio of intracavernous pressure (ICP) to mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the area under the ICP/MAP curve were effectively enhanced. The maximum ICP/MAP increased by 30% in the YS-10 group (0.86 ± 0.085) compared with the BCNI group (0.66 ± 0.058), which is close to 82% of the NC group (1.05 ± 0.033). Histopathological changes demonstrated significant reduction of smooth muscle atrophy, collagen deposition, and endothelial and neural dysfunction after YS-10 treatment, which have no statistical differences compared with ICA II group. Additionally, high-protein expression levels of β-Catenin and cyclin D1 were observed in the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: YS-10, a novel synthesized flavonoid compound, could effectively improve erectile dysfunction in rats after BCNI by alleviating pathological impairments; this effect may associate with the upregulation of β-Catenin and cyclin D1 in Wnt signaling pathway.","10.1111/andr.13065","Animals; Cyclin D1; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Flavonoids; Male; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Up-Regulation; Wnt Signaling Pathway; beta Catenin","Icariside II; cavernous nerve injury; erectile dysfunction; flavonoid","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The syndrome occurs when the pudendal nerve or one of its branches is compressed, stretched, or injured. Double crush is the compression of a peripheral nerve at two or more separate areas with various signs and symptoms. We, herein, aimed to introduce the case of a 42-year-old male who underwent the distal release procedure due to the diagnosis of ""double crush pudendal syndrome"" following a proximal release surgery previously performed elsewhere. The patient's history revealed a pelvic fracture with urethral injury 27 years ago. Throughout the years, the patient had been evaluated by various medical disciplines and undergone several treatments. In 2017, an orthopedic surgeon performed proximal pudendal nerve release using transgluteal approach, and then rectal pain and defecation complaints relieved. However, in 2019, the patient was referred to our clinic because of the persistence of erection and perineal complaints after the proximal pudendal nerve release. Based on a detailed clinical and laboratory assessment, the diagnosis of double crush neuropathy was established, and distal release of the pudendal nerve using transperineal approach was performed. To determine the efficiency of the surgical treatment, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QAQ) tests were used preoperatively and at the first postoperative year. Furthermore, to assess the perineal pain, erection pain, and pain during intercourse Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used. The erectile dysfunction improved from the severe degree (9 points) to the mild degree (22 points) postoperatively. The patient's general and sexual satisfaction scores, and erection quality score improved compared to the preoperative baseline. According to VAS, the perineal pain, erectile pain,and pain during intercourse decreased postoperatively. (from 7 to 2 out of 10, from 8 to 3 out of 10, from 7 to 2 out of 10, respectively). When perineal and sexual complaints are encountered following pelvic trauma, the pudendal nerve-related problems, especially double crush syndrome, should be kept in mind in differential diagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach must be established in order to avoid any delay in diagnosis and treatment. Surgical intervention may provide a significant improvement in clinical and functional status.","10.5152/j.aott.2021.20208","Adult; Diagnosis, Differential; Erectile Dysfunction; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Male; Microvascular Decompression Surgery; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pelvis; Pudendal Neuralgia; Reoperation; Treatment Outcome","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

While it encompasses several ejaculatory disorders, weak ejaculation is seldom described in the literature. Since the pudendal nerve is the main nerve of ejaculation, we aim to hypothesize that pudendal nerve entrapment could be a cause of weak ejaculation, and that pudendal nerve release could contribute to the improvement of the ejaculatory stream. We presented two cases suffering from a weak ejaculatory stream and sensation of incomplete semen emptying, accompanied with clinical features of pudendal nerve entrapment. Both cases improved after pudendal nerve block and then laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal release, with a sustained amelioration of the ejaculatory stream after 3 weeks of surgery. Pudendal canal entrapment is therefore a potentially curable cause for weak ejaculation.","10.1038/s41443-021-00443-6","Ejaculation; Humans; Male; Pudendal Nerve; Pudendal Neuralgia; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological","","Journal Article; Review"

This cross-sectional study aimed to compare sexual function in patients with IIM to age-/sex-matched healthy controls (HC) and determine the potential impact of clinical features on sexual function. METHODS: In total, 122 women (61 with IIM, 61 age-matched HC) and 22 men (11 with IIM, 11 age-matched HC) aged 18-80 years completed gender-specific selection of 7 well-established and validated questionnaires assessing sexual health and function (Female Sexual Function Index, Brief Index of Sexual Function for Women, Sexual Function Questionnaire, Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire-Female, International Index of Erectile Function, Male Sexual Health Questionnaire, Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire-Male). Results were compared between patients and HC and correlated with selected disease-related features. RESULTS: The prevalence of sexual dysfunction in IIM was 59% in women (vs 40% in HC), and 64% (vs 9% in HC) in men. Men and women with IIM reported significantly impaired sexual function compared with sex-/age-matched HC. Decreased sexual function was associated with muscle weakness, disability, physical inactivity, fatigue, depression and decreased quality of life.

"33882732","Sexual dimorphic role of the glucocorticoid receptor in chronic muscle pain produced by early-life stress.","Green PG; Alvarez P; Levine JD","Molecular pain","2021","Fibromyalgia and other chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes are associated with stressful early life events, which can produce a persistent dysregulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) stress axis function, associated with elevated plasm levels of corticosterone in adults. To determine the contribution of the HPA axis to persistent muscle hyperalgesia in adult rats that had experienced neonatal limited bedding (NLB), a form of early-life stress, we evaluated the role of glucocorticoid receptors on muscle nociceptors in adult NLB rats. In adult male and female NLB rats, mechanical nociceptive threshold in skeletal muscle was significantly lower than in adult control (neonatal standard bedding) rats. Furthermore, adult males and females that received exogenous corticosterone (via dams' milk) during postnatal days 2-9, displayed a similar lowered mechanical nociceptive threshold. To test the hypothesis that persistent glucocorticoid receptor signaling in the adult contributes to muscle hyperalgesia in NLB rats, nociceptor expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was attenuated by spinal intrathecal administration of an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) antisense to GR mRNA. In adult NLB rats, GR antisense markedly attenuated muscle hyperalgesia in males, but not in females. These findings indicate that increased corticosterone levels during a critical developmental period (postnatal days 2-9) produced by NLB stress induces chronic mechanical hyperalgesia in male and female rats that persists in adulthood, and that this chronic muscle hyperalgesia is mediated, at least in part, by persistent stimulation of glucocorticoid receptors on sensory neurons, in the adult male, but not female rat.","10.1177/17448069211011313","Animals; Chronic Pain; Female; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Myalgia; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Rats; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; Sex Characteristics; Signal Transduction; Stress, Psychological","Early life adverse events; corticosterone; muscle hyperalgesia; neonatal limited bedding; sex differences","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

The synthesized polymer was electrospun in a rotating drum to prepare nanofiber meshes (NMs). Human MSCs were prepared and confirmed. Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups of six each: group 1-sham operation; group 2-CN injury; group 3-MSCs treatment after CN injury; group 4-nanofibrous scaffold treatment after CN injury; and group 5-post-CN injury treatment combining a nanofibrous scaffold and MSCs (nano-MSCs). In the latter group, the damaged CN was instantly surrounded by an MSC-containing a nanofibrous scaffold in the aftermath of injury. Morphological analysis and immuno-histochemical staining in relation to nerves (Tuj1, NF, MAP2, MBP and peripherin), endothelium (vWF), smooth muscle (SMA), neurofilament (NF), and apoptosis (TUNEL) were performed. We evaluated the mean proportion expressed as a percentage of the ratio of muscle to collagen of penile cavernous smooth-muscle cells as well as the expression of cavernous SMA, NF, vWF, and TUNEL makers. Compared to the group free of CN injury, erectile function was markedly reduced in the group with CN injury at 2 and 4 weeks (p < 0.05). By contrast, compared to the sham operation group, erectile function was better in the group with MSC transplantation (p < 0.05). Similarly, by comparison to the group solely with hMSCs, erectile function was better in the group with nano-MSC transplantation (p < 0.05). Transplantation of MSCs demonstrated the neuronal differentiation. By contrast to MSCs on their own, neuronal differentiation was more significantly expressed in nano-MSCs. The mean proportion expressed as a percentage of the ratio of muscle to collagen of penile cavernous smooth-muscle cells, the expression of cavernous SMA, NF, vWF, and apoptosis improved in the cavernosum after transplantation. NMs showed synergy with MSCs for the repair of erectile dysfunction. Transplanted MSCs differentiated into neuron-like cells and repaired erectile dysfunction in the rats with CN injury.

Currently, there is no uniformly adopted treatment strategy. Invasive treatments, such as surgery (i.e. microdiscectomy) and transforaminal epidural steroid injection, are often reserved for failed conservative treatment. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of microdiscectomy with transforaminal epidural steroid injection for the management of radicular pain secondary to lumbar prolapsed intervertebral disc for non-emergency presentation of sciatica of < 12 months' duration. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to either (1) microdiscectomy or (2) transforaminal epidural steroid injection. DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentre, randomised prospective trial comparing microdiscectomy with transforaminal epidural steroid injection for sciatica due to prolapsed intervertebral disc with < 1 year symptom duration. SETTING: NHS services providing secondary spinal surgical care within the UK. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 163 participants (aged 16-65 years) were recruited from 11 UK NHS outpatient clinics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was participant-completed Oswestry Disability Questionnaire score at 18 weeks post randomisation. Secondary outcomes were visual analogue scores for leg pain and back pain; modified Roland-Morris score (for sciatica), Core Outcome Measures Index score and participant satisfaction at 12-weekly intervals. Cost-effectiveness and quality of life were assessed using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version; Hospital Episode Statistics data; medication usage; and self-reported cost data at 12-weekly intervals. Adverse event data were collected. The economic outcome was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from the perspective of the NHS in England. RESULTS: Eighty-three participants were allocated to transforaminal epidural steroid injection and 80 participants were allocated to microdiscectomy, using an online randomisation system. At week 18, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire scores had decreased, relative to baseline, by 26.7 points in the microdiscectomy group and by 24.5 points in the transforaminal epidural steroid injection. The difference between the treatments was not statistically significant (estimated treatment effect -4.25 points, 95% confidence interval -11.09 to 2.59 points). Nor were there significant differences between treatments in any of the secondary outcomes: Oswestry Disability Questionnaire scores, visual analogue scores for leg pain and back pain, modified Roland-Morris score and Core Outcome Measures Index score up to 54 weeks. There were four (3.8%) serious adverse events in the microdiscectomy group, including one nerve palsy (foot drop), and none in the transforaminal epidural steroid injection group. Compared with transforaminal epidural steroid injection, microdiscectomy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £38,737 per quality-adjusted life-year gained and a probability of 0.17 of being cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. LIMITATIONS: Primary outcome data was invalid or incomplete for 24% of participants. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness to assumptions made regarding missing data. Eighteen per cent of participants in the transforaminal epidural steroid injection group subsequently received microdiscectomy prior to their primary outcome assessment. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the NErve Root Block VErsus Surgery trial is the first trial to evaluate the comparative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of microdiscectomy and transforaminal epidural steroid injection. No statistically significant difference was found between the two treatments for the primary outcome. It is unlikely that microdiscectomy is cost-effective compared with transforaminal epidural steroid injection at a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year for sciatica secondary to prolapsed intervertebral disc. FUTURE WORK: These results will lead to further studies in the streamlining and earlier management of discogenic sciatica.

See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?: Sciatica or pain related to nerve irritation travelling down the leg is common in young working adults and most likely to be caused by a ‘slipped’ (prolapsed) disc. Although the majority of cases get better on their own and within 4–6 weeks, a significant group of patients struggle with disabling symptoms sometimes beyond 1 year. Consequently, patients struggle to maintain their home and working lives. Many treatments are available for sciatica, but simpler treatments (e.g. pain tablets, physiotherapy and changing one’s lifestyle) are often not very effective and patients have often tried all of them by the time they are seen in hospital to have tests, such as scans, done. Surgery to remove part of the disc is recommended in cases where the pain is accompanied by severe weakness in one or both legs, or where doctors think that nerves may be damaged because patients have bladder, bowel and sexual functioning difficulties (i.e. red flag symptoms). Surgery works well in alleviation of referred leg pain and also to relieve pressure on a physically compressed nerve that may be showing clinical sign of injury/weakness. An alternative to surgery is to inject a mixture of anaesthetic and steroid close to the site of the disc injury and nerve, but at the moment we do not know whether or not these injections work in the long term. They are cheaper and less invasive, with fewer risks than surgery, such as from anaesthetic or infection. WHAT DID OUR STUDY INVESTIGATE?: This study compared the usefulness of surgery with injections for patients who have had sciatica for < 1 year and who have tried simple remedies but are still in pain. Patients were allocated to have either surgery or the injection. Symptoms (e.g. pain) were assessed after 18 weeks. WHAT DID WE FIND?: We found that there was no significant difference between surgery and injection at the primary end point. Surgery was not significantly different from injection in terms of clinical outcome and was not cost-effective compared with injection. OUR CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Given the cost of surgery and the risks to patients, we suggest that further studies should be carried out to explore whether or not all patients with sciatica due to a slipped disc should be considered suitable for an injection, unless there is a good reason not to.","10.3310/hta25240","Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Sciatica; Steroids","CLINICAL TRIAL; COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT; INJECTION; MICRODISCECTOMY; PROLAPSED DISC; PROLAPSED INTERVERTEBRAL DISC; RANDOMISED; SCIATICA; SURGERY; TRANSFORAMINAL EPIDURAL STEROID INJECTION","Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Pragmatic Clinical Trial"

In a small fraction, symptomatic TC can cause pain, bowel, bladder and/or sexual dysfunction, as well as motor and sensory deficits. While many surgeons regard TCs as a non-operative entity, there have been suggestions that operative intervention in carefully selected symptomatic patients may be beneficial. The aim of this meta-analysis is to identify whether surgical treatment for symptomatic TCs is beneficial with an acceptable complication profile.Materials and methods: The authors conducted a systematic outcome analysis of symptomatic TCs treated either with surgery or conservatively managed.Results: Sixteen studies (N = 238) met the inclusion criteria for final meta-analysis. The literature search was performed using PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases up to September 2017 and with an updated search in April 2019. The post-operative complication rate in patients undergoing surgical intervention was 16.9 (11.8 to 22.7) and cyst recurrence was 8.5 (3.5 to 15.4). When a complication occurred, the most frequent complication of surgical intervention was the development of a surgical site infection and/or CSF leak. Of the 15 studies reporting long-term follow-up, 81.0 (74.0-88.0) of patients remained symptom-free for more than 1 year (Mean: 27.5 months, SD = 11.5).Conclusion: We rigorously analyse the efficacy of open surgical decompression and repair of symptomatic TCs and corroborate the findings of sustained long-term resolution of symptoms.","10.1080/02688697.2021.1874294","Humans; Decompression, Surgical; Pain; Tarlov Cysts","Tarlov cysts; efficacy; lumbosacral perineural cysts; meta-analysis; surgical intervention","Systematic Review; Meta-Analysis; Journal Article"

AIM: To determine factors released from PRP and explore their role in mediating preservation of erectile function (EF) in a rat model of CN injury. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 10 weeks) were used in this study. 6 rats were used to obtain blood for PRP and whole plasma preparation. We probed samples using a cytokine antibody array and performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We determined the expression patterns of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5) and receptors in the major pelvic ganglion (MPG) and corpus cavernosum via immunostaining. 32 rats were divided into 4 groups based on the type of injection received: (i) sham, (ii) vehicle, (iii) 400 μL of PRP, and (iv) 30 ng/kg of CXCL5. Groups 2-4 were subjected to bilateral CN crush (BCNC) injury. 4 weeks later, EF was assessed by CN electrostimulation, and CNs and penile tissue were collected for histological analysis. OUTCOME: Cytokine antibody array, ELISA, erectile response, and immunofluorescence staining readings. RESULTS: The PRP contained high levels of CXCL5. MPG neurons expressed CXCL5 and CXCR2. PRP intracavernous injection stabilized CXCR2 and increased CXCL5 expression in the MPG after BCNC, thus enhancing neuroprotection. CXCL5 injection improved BCNC-induced erectile dysfunction by preventing smooth muscle atrophy. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The therapeutic efficacy of PRP in CN injury-induced erectile dysfunction may arise from the synergy among multiple biomolecules. Our study serves as a basis for future studies on PRP formulation to provide safe and effective medications for the maintenance of EF after radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: A strength of our study is that our model was able to isolate the role of cytokines, specifically CXCL5, as part of the mechanism responsible for PRP's protective properties. However, the rat cytokine array provided limited experimental targets. The rats used were not at the age corresponding to prostate cancer patients in clinical settings. Our study did not explore CXCL5 blocking in the PRP group. Finally, the main protein quantification results by western blotting were hampered because of small tissue samples. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the role of CXCL5 and CXCR2 as mediators of PRP effects in the preservation of EF after CN injury. Wu YN, Liao CH, Chen KC, et al.

"33686480","Chemotherapeutic Agent-Induced Vulvodynia, an Experimental Model.","Rangappa S; Shankar VK; Jo S; Repka MA; Murthy SN","AAPS PharmSciTech","2021","Vulvodynia is a chronic clinical condition associated with vulvar pain that can impair the sexual, social, and psychological life of women. There is a need for more research to develop novel strategies and therapies for the treatment of vulvodynia. Vulvodynia in experimental animal models induced via infections, allergens, and diabetes are tedious and with lessor induction rate. The objective of the study was to explore the possibility of inducing vulvodynia using a chemotherapeutic agent in a rodent model. Paclitaxel is commonly used in treating breast and ovarian cancer, whose dose-limiting side effect is peripheral neuropathy. Studies have shown that peripheral neuropathy is one of the etiologies for vulvodynia. Following paclitaxel administration (2 mg/kg i.p.), the intensity of vulvar hypersensitivity was assessed using a series of von Frey filaments (0.008 to 1 g) to ensure the induction of vulvodynia. Vulvodynia was induced from day 2 and was well sustained for 11 days. Furthermore, the induced vulvodynia was validated by investigating the potentiation of a flinch response threshold, upon topical application and systemic administration of gabapentin, a commonly used medication for treating neuropathic pain. The results demonstrate that vulvodynia was induced due to administration of paclitaxel. The fact that chemotherapeutic agent-induced vulvodynia was responsive to topical and parenterally administered gabapentin provides validity to the model. The study establishes a new, relatively simple and reliable animal model for screening drug molecules for vulvar hypersensitivity.","10.1208/s12249-021-01969-0","Analgesics; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gabapentin; Neuralgia; Paclitaxel; Pain Measurement; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Vulvodynia","flinch response; gabapentin; paclitaxel; von Frey filaments; vulvodynia","Journal Article"

Urgent surgical decompression aims to prevent progressive neurological deficit. Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (CES), such as back pain, sciatica and bladder dysfunction are common in the population, but the majority of those investigated do not have radiological cauda equina compression. However, a missed diagnosis can have significant medical, social and legal consequences. We investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentation and management of suspected CES. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed referral, investigation and treatment of CES in a regional neurosurgical centre during the initial COVID-19 surge between March and May 2020 compared with March to May 2019. RESULTS: Referrals for suspected CES were similar during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 275) compared with 2019 (n = 261, p = 0.596) despite a significant (19%) decrease in total emergency neurosurgical referrals (1248 in 2020 vs 1544 in 2019, p < 0.001). Nineteen (7%) of the suspected CES referrals underwent decompression in 2020, similar to 16 (6%) in 2019 (p = 0.867). There were no differences in outcomes or complications and no evidence of delays in presentation or treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other emergency neurosurgical conditions, the number of referrals for suspected CES and the percentage of referrals with radiological cauda equina compression were unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistence of CES referrals when many people stayed away from hospital highlights the distress and worry caused by suspected CES and its symptoms to both patients and healthcare providers.","10.1308/rcsann.2021.0011","COVID-19; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Humans; Neurosurgical Procedures; Referral and Consultation; Retrospective Studies; Scotland","COVID-19; Cauda equina syndrome; Epidemiology; Neurosurgery; Orthopaedics","Journal Article"

Cardiac manifestations include heart failure, atrial fibrillation, intolerance to previously prescribed antihypertensives, sinus node dysfunction, and atrioventricular block, resulting in the need for permanent pacing. Neurologic manifestations include progressive sensorimotor neuropathy (e.g., pain, weakness) and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., erectile dysfunction, chronic diarrhea, orthostatic hypotension). Non-cardiac red flags often precede the diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis and include musculoskeletal manifestations (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, spontaneous rupture of the distal tendon biceps, shoulder and knee surgery). Awareness and recognition of the constellation of symptoms, including cardiac, neurologic, and musculoskeletal manifestations, will help with early diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis and faster access to therapies, thereby slowing the progression of this debilitating disease.","10.1007/s10741-021-10080-2","Amyloid; Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial; Diagnostic Errors; Humans; Male; Prealbumin","ATTRv; Amyloidosis; Cardiomyopathy; Transthyretin amyloidosis; hATTR","Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

There is a paucity of data relating to the prevalence of these long-term complications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the long-term prevalence of CES-related bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction and impact on quality of life to inform service provision. METHODS: Participants were selected through coding of operative records of patients who underwent lumbar decompression for CES secondary to a herniated intervertebral disc at two large UK neurosurgical departments between 2011 and 2015 inclusive. A telephone-based survey including both validated and modified tools was used to collect data pertaining to bladder, bowel, and sexual function and impact on quality of life both before development of CES and at the time of the survey, at least 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: Of 135 patients contacted, 71 (42 male, 29 female) responded. Post-CES compared to pre-CES, there was higher prevalence and significant intrarespondent deterioration of bowel dysfunction, bladder dysfunction, perception of bladder function, sexual function, effect of back pain on sex life, and activities of daily living/quality of life (p < .0001 for all). Significant differences in individual questions pre-CES versus post-CES were also found. CONCLUSION: We show high prevalence of long-term bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction post-CES, with functional and psychosocial consequences. Our results demonstrate the need for preoperative information and subsequent screening and long-term multidisciplinary support for these complications.","10.46292/sci19-00065","Cauda Equina Syndrome; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Male; Quality of Life; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urination Disorders","back pain; cauda equina syndrome; quality of life; sexual function; sphincter dysfunction","Journal Article; Observational Study"

A discrete choice experiment was used to obtain patients' preferences regarding treatment with systemic or topical pain medication. Patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (pNP) were recruited in two pain-focused practices in Germany. To identify relevant attributes of topical or systemic pain medication, a literature review and face-to-face interviews with experts for pain treatment were conducted. The attributes used in the choice scenarios were noticeable onset of effect, time spent in medical office, risk of systemic and local side effects, and impairment of daily life with regard to sleep quality and sexuality. The model was estimated with a mixed multinomial logit regression model. The study included 153 participants suffering from moderate to severe pNP. Most important attributes from patient's perspective was noticeable onset of effect (odds ratio 2.141 [95% confidence interval 1.837 to 2.494]), followed by risk of systemic side effects (2.038 [1.731 to 2.400]) and risk of sexual dysfunction (1.839 [1.580 to 2.140]), while risk of local side effects regarding skin ranked fourth (1.612 [1.321 to 1.966]). The impairment of sleep quality was also significant but less important (1.556 [1.346 to 1.798]). Local side effects were more likely to be accepted than systemic side effects. The risk of sexual dysfunction as a side effect of treatment is very important for patients, although it has received little attention in the literature.","10.1111/papr.12989","Choice Behavior; Germany; Humans; Neuralgia; Pain Management; Patient Preference","discrete choice experiment; oral treatment; patient preferences; peripheral neuropathic pain; topical treatment","Journal Article; Review"

Acute pain, comprising nociceptive and inflammatory pain warns us about the presence of damage or harmful stimuli. However, it can be efficiently reversed by opioid analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Prostaglandin E2 and I2, the representative lipid mediators, are well-known causes of acute pain. However, some lipid mediators such as lipoxins, resolvins or endocannabinoids suppress acute pain. Various types of peripheral and central neuropathic pain (NeuP) as well as fibromyalgia (FM) are representatives of chronic pain and refractory owing to abnormal pain processing distinct from acute pain. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that lipid mediators represented by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are involved in the initiation and maintenance of both NeuP and FM in experimental animal models. The LPAR1-mediated peripheral mechanisms including dorsal root demyelination, Cavα2δ1 expression in dorsal root ganglion, and LPAR3-mediated amplification of central LPA production via glial cells are involved in the series of molecular mechanisms underlying NeuP. This review also discusses the involvement of lipid mediators in emerging research directives, including itch-sensing, sexual dimorphism, and the peripheral immune system.","10.1016/j.plipres.2020.101079","Animals; Chronic Pain; Lysophospholipids; Neuralgia; Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid","Fibromyalgia; Immune system; Itch; Lysophosphatidic acid; Neuropathic pain; Sphingosine-1-phosphate","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

To investigate the effect of exogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the phenotypic modulation of CCSMCs in BCNI-ED rats, a total of 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into 3 groups, including sham-operated (Sham) group, BCNI group and BCNI treated with NaHS (BCNI + NaHS) group. The treated group received intraperitoneal injection of NaHS (100 μmol kg-1day-1) for 4 weeks starting day 1 postoperatively. Erectile function was measured by the ratio of intracavernous pressure (ICP)/mean arterial pressure (MAP), and relevant tissues were harvested for Immunohistochemistry, Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson's trichrome staining, H2S fluorescent probe WSP-1 and Western blot. The primary CCSMCs were isolated and pretreatment with NaHS before exposed to PDGF-BB (platelet-derived growth factor). Relative expression mRNA and protein of phenotypic biomarkers, RhoA, ROCK-1 and cell cycle proteins were detected. Cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) and H2S levels in penile tissue was significantly decreased in the BCNI group compared with the Sham group. Compared with the BCNI group, administration of NaHS significantly increased the ratio of ICP/MAP, ratio of smooth muscle to collagen, expressions of a-SMA, calponin and decreased the expression of OPN, collagen-I, RhoA, ROCK1 in the penile tissue. PDGF-BB-treated CCSMCs exhibited higher expression of OPN, RhoA, ROCK1, and lower α-SMA, calponin, which were attenuated by NaHS pretreatment. NaHS suppressed RhoA/ROCK activity and decreased the expression of CDK2, Cyclin E1, while increased the expression of P27kip1 induced by PDGF-BB in CCSMCs. Taken together, this study indicated that exogenous H2S inhibited the phenotypic modulation of CCSMCs by suppressing RhoA/ROCK1 signaling and affecting its downstream factor, CDK2, Cyclin E1, P27kip1, thereby improved BCNI rat erectile function.","10.1016/j.niox.2020.11.003","Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Survival; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27; Cyclins; Erectile Dysfunction; Hydrogen Sulfide; Male; Muscle, Smooth; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Signal Transduction; rho GTP-Binding Proteins; rho-Associated Kinases; Rats","Bilateral cavernous nerve injury; Erectile dysfunction; Hydrogen sulfide; Phenotype modulation; Radical prostatectomy; RhoA/ROCK","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

There is a need to continue examining neuro-immune-endocrine crosstalk in the context of sexual dimorphisms in chronic pain. Several phenomena in particular need to be further explored. In patients, autoantibodies to neural antigens have been associated with sensory pathway hyper-excitability, and the role of self-antigens released by damaged nerves remains to be defined. In addition, specific immune cells release pro-nociceptive cytokines that directly influence neural firing, while T lymphocytes activated by specific antigens secrete factors that either support nerve repair or exacerbate the damage. Modulating specific immune cell populations could therefore be a means to promote nerve recovery, with sex-specific outcomes. Understanding biological sex differences that maintain, or fail to maintain, neuroimmune homeostasis may inform the selection of sex-specific treatment regimens, improving chronic pain management by rebalancing neuroimmune feedback. Given the significance of interactions between nerves and immune cells in the generation and maintenance of neuropathic pain, this review focuses on sex differences and possible links with persistent autoimmune activity using sciatica as an example.","10.1186/s13293-020-00339-y","Animals; Autoimmunity; Chronic Pain; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Neuroimmunomodulation; Sciatica; Sex Characteristics; Sex Chromosomes","Autoimmune; Chronic pain; Gonadal hormone; Immune system; Nociceptor; Sex difference; X chromosome inactivation","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

METHODS: We carried out a prospective study of consecutive patients presenting with the clinical features of CES to a regional neurosurgery center comprising semi-structured interview and questionnaires investigating presenting symptoms, neurologic examination, psychiatric and functional disorder comorbidity, bladder/bowel/sexual function, distress, and disability. RESULTS: A total of 198 patients presented consecutively over 28 months. A total of 47 were diagnosed with scan-positive CES (mean age 48 years, 43% female). A total of 76 mixed category patients had nerve root compression/displacement without CES compression (mean age 46 years, 71% female) and 61 patients had scan-negative CES (mean age 40 years, 77% female). An alternative neurologic cause of CES emerged in 14/198 patients during admission and 4/151 patients with mean duration 25 months follow-up. Patients with scan-negative CES had more positive clinical signs of a functional neurologic disorder (11% scan-positive CES vs 34% mixed and 68% scan-negative, p < 0.0001), were more likely to describe their current back pain as worst ever (41% vs 46% and 70%, p = 0.005), and were more likely to have symptoms of a panic attack at onset (37% vs 57% and 70%, p = 0.001). Patients with scan-positive CES were more likely to have reduced/absent bilateral ankle jerks (78% vs 30% and 12%, p < 0.0001).

METHODS: Fifty-six 12-week-old rats were randomized into the four groups: sham surgery (S), CNCI (I), and CNCI treated with daily administration of 25.0 mg/kg SAHA (V) or 20.0 mg/kg udenafil (P). Group-V and Group-P received the respective treatment for 5-weeks from the following day after CNCI. At 5 weeks after surgery, dynamic infusion cavernosometry (DIC), histological staining, and Western blot analysis were performed. RESULTS: Group-I had a significantly decreased papaverine response, higher maintenance rate or drop rate, lower smooth muscle (SM)/collagen ratio, decreased SM content, and increased protein expression of HDAC2, HDAC3, TGF-β1, and collagen-1, compared with Group-S. The three DIC parameters in Group-V and Group-P significantly improved compared to those in Group-I. Except for the maintenance rate, the improvement in papaverine response and drop rate in Group-V was not significantly different from that in Group-P. Group-V and Group-P showed the rectification of SM/collagen ratio and protein expression of TGF-β1 or collagen-1. SM content was improved in Group-P, but not in Group-V. Group-V showed the normalization of protein expression of both HDAC2 and HDAC3, whereas protein expression of only HDAC2 was partially restored in Group-P. DISCUSSION: Treatment strategies targeting the HDAC pathway might be helpful to alleviate CVOD induced by CN injury. CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, chronic administration of SAHA improves post-injury CVOD by suppressing cavernosal fibrosis via rectifying the HDAC/TGF-β1 pathway in nerve-injured rats, comparable to that with PDE5 inhibitors.","10.1111/andr.12922","Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Fibrosis; Histone Deacetylases; Impotence, Vasculogenic; Male; Nerve Crush; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors; Rats; Venous Insufficiency; Vorinostat","erectile dysfunction; fibrosis; histone deacetylase; prostatectomy","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using 3 focal groups consisting of patients, families, and healthcare professionals. A thematic guide was prepared, and the information from the interviews was gathered using a sound recorder. In order to analyse the information, the transcriptions were coded and the significant data of each interview were extracted and grouped into various topics. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The main worries of the 3 groups were along the same line. On the one hand, the importance of a coordinated multidisciplinary team in the same unit that provides the integral care. On the other hand, sport as a common interest in these adolescents, and the consideration of a positive relationship between leisure and quality of life, finding that their participation in physiotherapy groups of great use. To achieve this objective, it is necessary to improve the coordination between the hospital and the different groups. The parents also demanded better cover in the social and psychological care offered by the hospital. Lastly, the importance of humanising the care was mentioned (privacy, adapting of structures, transmission of information, sexuality…).","10.1016/j.jhqr.2020.06.009","Adolescent; Focus Groups; Humans; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Parents; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life","Asistencia sanitaria; Calidad de vida; Distrofia muscular de Duchenne; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Focal groups; Grupos focales; Health care; Investigación cualitativa; Qualitative research; Quality of life","Journal Article"

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 3039 Korean women, aged 45-65 years, who attended their routine health checkup. Their scores from the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were compared and participants were categorized into four groups according to stage of menopause: premenopause, early menopause (≤2 years from their last menstruation), mid-menopause (2-8 years), and late menopause (>8 years). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 52.81 ± 5.39 years, and 98.5 % of them reported one or more symptoms included in the MRS. The most common symptom was physical/mental exhaustion, experienced by 86.7 % of participants. The prevalence of moderate to severe symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms, heart discomfort, sleep problems, sexual problems, vaginal dryness, and joint/muscular discomfort, increased in the early menopausal period. This increased in the late menopausal period compared with its prevalence at premenopause. The prevalence of moderate to severe psychological symptoms, heart discomfort, and sleep problems followed a U-shaped trend after menopause: high at early menopause, low at mid-menopause, and high again at late menopause. A low level of physical exercise was an independent risk factor for a high total MRS score; however, the menopausal stages, age, and weight were also variously associated with menopausal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Several menopausal symptoms remain severe, or are aggravated, until the late menopausal period among Korean women. More attention is warranted to manage these symptoms in postmenopausal women.","10.1016/j.maturitas.2020.05.023","Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fatigue; Female; Hot Flashes; Humans; Joint Diseases; Menopause; Middle Aged; Muscular Diseases; Prevalence; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sleep Wake Disorders; Vaginal Diseases","Menopausal symptoms; Menopause; Reproductive stage; Vasomotor symptoms; Years since menopause","Journal Article"

Here, we evaluated the impact of stress on CIPN induced by oxaliplatin, and its underlying mechanisms, in male and female rats. A single dose of oxaliplatin produced mechanical hyperalgesia of similar magnitude in both sexes, still present at similar magnitude in both sexes, on day 28. Adrenalectomy mitigated oxaliplatin-induced hyperalgesia, in both sexes. To confirm the role of neuroendocrine stress axes in CIPN, intrathecal administration of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting β₂-adrenergic receptor mRNA both prevented and reversed oxaliplatin-induced hyperalgesia, only in males. By contrast, glucocorticoid receptor antisense oligodeoxynucleotide prevented and reversed oxaliplatin-induced hyperalgesia in both sexes. Unpredictable sound stress enhanced CIPN, in both sexes. The administration of stress hormones, epinephrine, corticosterone, and their combination, at stress levels, mimicked the effects of sound stress on CIPN, in males. In females, only corticosterone mimicked the effect of sound stress. Also, a risk factor for CIPN, early-life stress, was evaluated by producing both stress-sensitive (produced by neonatal limited bedding) and stress-resilient (produced by neonatal handling) phenotypes in adults. Although neonatal limited bedding significantly enhanced CIPN only in female adults, neonatal handling significantly attenuated CIPN, in both sexes. Our study demonstrates a sexually dimorphic role of the 2 major neuroendocrine stress axes in oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain.","10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002073","Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Female; Hyperalgesia; Male; Neuralgia; Oxaliplatin; Rats; Sex Characteristics","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

The aim of this study was to assess the association of large-fiber peripheral neuropathy with erectile dysfunction in adult US males with and without diabetes. METHODS: We included all men aged ≥40 years from the 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with data on erectile dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy (n = 1213, including 206 men with diabetes). Erectile dysfunction was assessed by a single question during a self-paced, computer-assisted self-interview. Peripheral neuropathy was evaluated using standardized 10-g monofilament testing, which assesses lower extremity sensation. We used logistic regression to examine the association of peripheral neuropathy with erectile dysfunction overall and stratified by diabetes status, adjusting for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy was 26.1% (51.2% in men with diabetes and 22.5% in men without diabetes). There was a significant independent association of peripheral neuropathy with erectile dysfunction overall (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.43) and among US adult men without diabetes (OR 1.68; 95% CI, 1.11-2.56). The association in adults with diabetes was not statistically significant (OR 1.29; 95% CI, 0.39-4.26), possibly owing to limited power in this subgroup.

However, the complication of postoperative urinary and sexual dysfunctions due to intraoperative nerve injury has yet to be improved. Based on the concept of membrane anatomy, we carried out a systematic study on the important membrane anatomical structure anterior to the rectum--Denonvilliers' fascia. From multiple aspects including anatomy, physiology, histochemistry and surgical practice, we verified the importance of Denonvilliers' fascia for TME surgery in prevention of intraoperative nerve injury and postoperative urogenital dysfunction. Moreover, based on anatomical study of the surgical marker line of Denonvilliers' fascia (Wei's line) and surgical plane, we proved that total mesorectal excision with preservation of Denonvilliers' fascia (iTME) was feasible and practical. Therefore, we conducted a large multicentric randomized controlled trial (RCT). The mid-term result demonstrated that compared with traditional TME surgery, iTME was more effective in reducing the incidence of postoperative urinary and sexual dysfunctions in male patients with mid-low rectal cancer, without sacrifice of short-term tumor radical outcome. We believe that the final RCT result of iTME, based on membrane anatomy, will provide solid evidence for the update of concepts of rectal cancer surgery. 全直肠系膜切除术（TME）成为中低位直肠癌手术的金标准已近30年，然而因TME术中神经损伤导致的术后排尿及性功能障碍至今仍未得到明显改善。基于膜解剖的理念，我们对直肠前方的重要膜解剖结构——邓氏筋膜进行了细致而系统的研究，从解剖、生理、组织、手术实践等多方面，验证了保留邓氏筋膜对TME术中神经保护及术后排尿和性功能障碍预防的重要作用；并通过邓氏筋膜术中标记线及手术入路的解剖研究，明确了保留邓氏筋膜全直肠系膜切除术（iTME）的可操作性。据此，我们开展了一项大型多中心随机对照研究，中期研究结果显示，与传统TME相比，iTME在不影响短期肿瘤根治效果的前提下，能更好地降低男性中低位直肠癌患者术后排尿及性功能障碍发生率。我们相信，基于膜解剖的iTME随机对照试验最终研究成果，将为直肠癌手术理念的更新提供夯实的循证医学证据。.","10.3760/cma.j.cn.441530-20200430-00251","Fascia; Humans; Male; Mesentery; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Peritoneum; Proctectomy; Rectal Neoplasms; Rectum; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Urologic Diseases","Denonvilliers' fascia, preservation; Membrane anatomy; Randomized controlled trial; Total mesorectal excision","Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Randomized Controlled Trial"

It is unknown how psychosocial variables associated with PVD are differentially associated with mucosal versus muscle pain. Analysis of data from the National Vulvodynia Registry (n = 202) revealed several factors associated with increased mucosal pain: pain duration (P = .043), the McGill sensory subscore (P = .0086) and the Gracely pain scale (P< .001). Increased mucosal pain was also associated with decreased arousal (P = .036). On the other hand, factors significantly associated with greater muscle pain included number of comorbid pain conditions (P = .001), decreased intercourse frequency post PVD onset (P = .02) and higher scores on the McGill sensory (P = .0001) and affective (P = .0002) subscores, the Gracely pain scale (P = .0012), and state anxiety (P < .001). Sexual function was also significantly impacted by high pelvic floor muscular pain, with lower scores for arousal (P = .046), orgasm (P = .0014) and satisfaction (P = .013), and higher pain (P = .01). Significant differences in the relationship between muscle and mucosal pain for pain duration (P = .005), McGill affective score (P = .001), orgasm (P = .049), change in intercourse frequency (P = .027), and state anxiety (P = .030) suggest the possibility of mucosal or muscle pain predominant PVD subtypes.

We postulate obturator neuralgia can induce lower urinary tract symptoms and dyspareunia and be diagnosed by using three clinical signs characterizing neuralgia everywhere on the body: painful nerve trunk (at the entrance of the obturator canal; by vaginal or rectal examination), abnormal sensibility and painful skin rolling test in its cutaneous innervation territory (inferomedial skin of the thigh). To support our assumptions, three female patients with longstanding lower urinary tract symptoms and/or dyspareunia and a clinical examination suggestive of obturator neuralgia (three clinical signs positive) were treated by perineural injections of dextrose 5% in sterile water (D5W). The three patients were clinically improved or cured after the treatment with two of them being cured after a single injection.

Although reliability of PFM tenderness has been determined, validity has yet to be established. OBJECTIVES: To assess convergent validity of PFM tenderness on digital palpation with the presence of central pain mechanism, as determined by a score of greater than 40 on the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI). A secondary objective was to assess the agreement between PFM tenderness and self-reported symptoms of PFM sensitivity. METHODS: Participants completed a battery of self-report questions, the CSI, and various physical assessments (blinded assessors). Convergent validity was assessed between tenderness on palpation and the CSI. Kappa statistics were used to determine agreement between tenderness on palpation and self-reported perineal pain, urinary urgency, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea. RESULTS: Ninety-nine female participants with hip or back pain and at least one self-reported symptom of pelvic floor dysfunction were included in the study (mean age 40.56±12.72 years). Convergent validity was found between PFM tenderness on palpation and scores greater than 40 on the CSI (X12=4.2,p=0.04).

During semi-directed interviews, a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic factors and detailed questions about pain were collected. Then, pelvic and perineal pain were classified into 7 pain syndromes: pelvic sensitization (Convergences PP criteria), complex regional pain syndrome (Budapest criteria), pudendal or cluneal neuralgia (Nantes criteria), neuroma, thoraco-lumbar junction syndrome, myofascial pain (muscle trigger zone), fibromyalgia (American College of Rheumatology criteria). The principal objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of each painful disorder.

Primary lumbar paragangliomas are prominently vascularized, can present variably, and pose both diagnostic and surgical challenges. We report on a large case series with long-term follow-up and intraoperative footage to characterize the natural history, diagnostic approach, and operative approach to this rare surgical disease. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study including all patients with histologically confirmed primary lumbar paraganglioma treated at our tertiary neurosurgical center between 1997 and 2018. Clinical, radiologic, surgical, and histologic data were collected from medical records. RESULTS: There were 13 cases of primary lumbar paraganglioma (8 men [61.5%], 5 women [38.5%]; mean age, 51.3 years; range, 33.2-68.9 years). Symptom duration correlated with tumor size (Spearman r = 0.735, P = 0.01). The main presenting symptoms were lower back pain and radiculopathy, often long-standing with recent deterioration. Seven patients (53.8%) were admitted as emergency cases, including 3 with cauda equina syndrome. Preoperative differential diagnoses included nerve sheath tumor, ependymoma, meningioma, and disk herniation. The mean Ki-67 mitotic index was 5.7% (range, 1%-10%). Surgical resection improved pain in 8 of 13 patients (61.5%) and weakness improved in 5 of 5 patients (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Primary lumbar paragangliomas are rare neoplasms of the cauda equina that typically progress slowly but may also present acutely. They are often related to the filum terminale, which should be resected prior to other attachments intraoperatively to prevent displacement of the tumor out of view. Total resection can be curative, and long-term follow-up in this series found no recurrence.","10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.144","Adult; Aged; Cauda Equina; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Cohort Studies; Erectile Dysfunction; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Paraganglioma, Extra-Adrenal; Paraparesis; Paresthesia; Radiculopathy; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Cord Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Burden; Urinary Incontinence","Cauda equina; Filum terminale; Lumbar spine; Paraganglioma; Surgery","Journal Article"

Twenty-four male rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group, BCNC group, and BCNC + NAC group. NAC or equal volume of saline was daily administrated by intragastric gavage for 4 weeks. The initial and end penile lengths were measured. Intracavernosal pressure/mean arterial pressure (ICP/MAP) ratio was calculated to assess erectile function. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson's trichrome staining, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot were performed to explore cellular and molecular changes of the penis. Compared to the BCNC group, the penile length, ICP/MAP ratio and smooth muscle/collagen ratio in the BCNC + NAC group were improved significantly (all P < 0.05), and the expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, α-smooth muscle actin, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase 1 were significantly increased after NAC treated (all P < 0.05), along with the decreased expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, transforming growth factor-β1, collagen I, collagen III, collagen IV, malonaldehyde, and lysine oxidase (all P < 0.05). This study demonstrated that NAC could maintain penile length and partly improve erectile function. Possible mechanism is directly and/or indirectly related to antihypoxic and antifibrosis.","10.4103/aja.aja_17_20","Acetylcysteine; Actins; Animals; Collagen; Crush Injuries; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Fibrosis; Free Radical Scavengers; Glutathione; Glutathione Peroxidase; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Male; Malondialdehyde; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Organ Size; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Postoperative Complications; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase; Rats; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Glutathione Peroxidase GPX1","N-acetylcysteine; erectile dysfunction; penile fibrosis; penile length","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

To promote quality of life without psychotropic effects, cannabinoids other than Δ9-tetrahydrocannabidiol, including cannabidiol and its precursor cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), are being evaluated. Due to its instability, CBDA has been understudied, particularly as an anti-nociceptive agent. Adding a methyl ester group (CBDA-ME) significantly enhances its stability, facilitating analyses of its analgesic effects in vivo. This study examines early treatment efficacy of CBDA-ME in a rat model of peripherally induced NEP and evaluates sex as a biological variable. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: After 14 consecutive days of intraperitoneal CBDA-ME administration at 0.01, 0.1 and 1 μg·kg-1 , commencing 1 day after surgically implanting a sciatic nerve-constricting cuff to induce NEP, the anti-nociceptive efficacy of this cannabinoid was assessed in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats relative to vehicle-treated counterparts. In females, 2 and 4 μg·kg-1 daily doses of CBDA-ME were also evaluated. Behavioural tests were performed for hind paw mechanical and thermal withdrawal thresholds once a week for 8 weeks. At endpoint, in vivo electrophysiological recordings were obtained to characterize soma threshold changes in primary sensory neurons. KEY RESULTS: In males, CBDA-ME elicited a significant concentration-dependent chronic anti-hyperalgesic effect, also influencing both nociceptive and non-nociceptive mechanoreceptors, which were not observed in females at any of the concentrations tested. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Initiating treatment of a peripheral nerve injury with CBDA-ME at an early stage post-surgery provides anti-nociception in males, warranting further investigation into potential sexual dimorphisms underlying this response.","10.1111/bph.14997","Animals; Cannabinoids; Dronabinol; Esters; Female; Male; Neuralgia; Quality of Life; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

However, there is a lack of knowledge about its psychometric properties. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the test-retest reliability of the LiSat-11 and the associations between the global and domain-specific items in persons with LEoPs. DESIGN: A test-retest design, where data were collected by a postal survey. SETTING: University Hospital, Outpatient Clinic. PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional sample of persons (20 women and 31 men; mean age 72 years) with LEoPs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: LiSat-11, assessing how satisfied a person is with different aspects of life, such as life as a whole, vocation, economy, leisure, contacts with friends and acquaintances, sexual life, activities of daily living (ADLs), family life, partner relationship, somatic health, and psychological health. METHODS: LiSat-11 was administered on two occasions, 2 weeks apart. The test-retest reliability was evaluated by Kappa statistics, the percent agreement (PA), and the Svensson rank-invariant method. The association between the items was evaluated with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho). RESULTS: The Kappa coefficients showed good to excellent agreement (0.64-0.90) and the PA ≤1 point was high (>92%) for all items. No items showed any systematic or random disagreements according to the Svensson method. All domain-specific items correlated significantly with the global item ""Life as a whole"" (P < .01; rhos 0.41 to 0.75).

Clinical evidence suggests that stress is a risk factor for development and/or worsening of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). We evaluated the impact of stress and stress axis mediators on paclitaxel CIPN in male and female rats. Paclitaxel produced mechanical hyperalgesia, over the 4-day course of administration, peaking by day 7, and still present by day 28, with no significant difference between male and female rats. Paclitaxel hyperalgesia was enhanced in male and female rats previously exposed to unpredictable sound stress, but not in rats that were exposed to sound stress after developing paclitaxel CIPN. We evaluated the role of the neuroendocrine stress axes: in adrenalectomized rats, paclitaxel did not produce hyperalgesia. Intrathecal administration of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) reduced expression of β2-adrenergic receptors on nociceptors, and paclitaxel-induced hyperalgesia was slightly attenuated in males, but markedly attenuated in females. By contrast, after intrathecal administration of antisense ODN to decrease expression of glucocorticoid receptors, hyperalgesia was markedly attenuated in males, but unaffected in females. Both ODNs together markedly attenuated paclitaxel-induced hyperalgesia in both males and females. We evaluated paclitaxel-induced CIPN in stress-resilient (produced by neonatal handling) and stress-sensitive (produced by neonatal limited bedding). Neonatal handling significantly attenuated paclitaxel-induced CIPN in adult male, but not in adult female rats. Neonatal limited bedding did not affect the magnitude of paclitaxel-induced CIPN in either male or female. This study provides evidence that neuroendocrine stress axis activity has a marked, sexually dimorphic, effect on paclitaxel-induced painful CIPN.","10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001798","Animals; Endocrine System; Female; Hyperalgesia; Male; Neuralgia; Paclitaxel; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sex Characteristics; Stress, Physiological","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

The correct stratification of the level of sexual dysfunction allows the clinician to choose the best type of treatment, in order to reduce sexual complaints. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our review is to focus on the management of NSD due to central nervous system disorders and peripheral neuropathy. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review of the English-language literature was completed until July 2019 in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The following terms were included: [(neurogenic sexual dysfunction) OR neurogenic erectile dysfunction)] AND (treatment OR management). An Excel file was created respecting the following criteria: participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design (PICOS). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall, from 505 identified records, 52 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Finally, 46 original researches were included in quantitative analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil were proved to be effective and safe in first-line therapy of erectile dysfunction caused by neurogenic disorders. In addition, intracavernous injections of prostaglandin E1, papaverine, or phentolamine and vacuum systems have been a mainstay of second-line treatment for NSD, extremely successful in the spinal cord injury population. Surgical therapy via penile prosthesis implantation remains a viable alternative as a third-line approach and may also be utilised to assist men with bladder management, despite higher complication rates of infections. Despite poor evidence, a better understanding of female sexual dysfunction due to neurological complaints is needed, in order to find more efficacious therapies for intercourse and orgasmic phase. Further prospective studies are required to better clarify the more successful treatment in improving sexual function and quality of life of these patients.

Herein, we investigated the effect of SPCs on the recovery of erectile function (EF) in rat models with bilateral cavernous nerve (CN) injury. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into sham, vehicle only, or SPC treatment groups. Rats in the SPC treatment and vehicle groups were subjected to bilateral CN injury before intracavernosal injection. Intracavernosal injections of SPCs increased all EF parameters at day 28 after injury and simultaneously reduced apoptosis of the SMCs. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that SPCs maintained the integrity of the CC by preserving the structure of the adherens junctions. Tracking transplanted SPCs labeled with EdU showed that transplanted SPCs remained in the CC 28 days after treatment. Intracavernosal SPC injection restored EF after bilateral CN injury by reducing SMC apoptosis, which favored the maintenance of the structure of adherens junctions and regulated the stability of corporal vessels. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SPCs for treating ED in humans.","10.1155/2019/8520523","Animals; Apoptosis; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Male; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stem Cell Transplantation","","Journal Article"

Etiologies reported for PGAD are vascular, neurological, pharmacological, and psychological. Determining the neurophysiological etiology of PGAD began with developing an understanding of the underlying biomechanics of the pudendal nerve and the female sexual response. AIM: To summarize the anatomy, physiology, etiologies, diagnostics, and treatments of the pertinent peripheral nerves involved in the pathology of PGAD. METHODS: We performed a PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar search for English-language articles in peer-reviewed journals with no predefined time period for inclusion. Terms included ""humans""[All Fields] AND ""persistent""[All Fields] AND/OR (""genitalia""[All Fields] OR ""genital""[All Fields]) AND/OR ""arousal""[All Fields] AND/OR (""disease""[All Fields] OR ""disorder""[All Fields]) AND/OR ""nerve""[All Fields]. The main outcomes of the papers were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measures were the anatomy and physiology, etiologies, history and physical examination, diagnostic imaging, and current evidence for the treatment of PGAD related to the peripheral nervous system. RESULTS: Most of the literature for PGAD originates from case studies. The diagnosis of PGAD itself is still a debated topic of discussion. More recent data published indicate that this disease affects males, as well. CONCLUSION: Nerve entrapment may be a source of continuous arousal. Associated PGAD symptoms would depend on the segment of the nerve involved. Unwelcomed or unwanted arousal has been observed as the most common detrimental symptom. Pelvic 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging is recommended in all patients with suspected nerve entrapment. Lumbosacral 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging is recommended if a Tarlov cyst or a herniated intervertebral disc is suspected. If the peripheral nerve is the source of the pathology, surgical intervention may be curative. A multidisciplinary team approach consisting of a medical provider, pelvic floor physical therapist, and sex therapist has demonstrated benefits. There are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved evidenced-based treatments for PGAD. Klifto KM, Dellon AL. Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder: Review of Pertinent Peripheral Nerves.

METHODS: 10 oral contraceptive users at follicular phase (OC-FOL), 10 non-oral contraceptives users at follicular phase (NOC-FOL), and 10 non-oral contraceptives users at ovulation phase (NOC-OV) participated. Subjects performed 30 min of eccentric cycling at 90% of their maximal concentric power output (PO). Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC), creatine kinase activity (CK), muscle soreness (SOR), and pain pressure threshold of vastus lateralis (PPT-VL) was assessed before, immediately after, and 24-96 h after cycling. Salivary estrogen, progesterone and testosterone concentrations were measured before, 72 and 96 h after exercise. RESULTS: No difference in estrogen levels between users and non-users was observed. Testosterone was 45% lower in OC-FOL than NOC-FOL at 96 h post-exercise (P = 0.01). Progesterone was 30.8-fold higher in NOC-OV than OC-FOL and 9.7-fold higher than NOC-FOL at 96 h post-exercise. The NOC-FOL recovered all indirect markers of muscle damage by 72 h post-exercise (P > 0.05). NOC-OV recovered MVC strength and muscle soreness (SOR and PPT-VL) by 96 h post-exercise (P > 0.05). OC-FOL did not recover baseline values of MVC, SOR, CK, and PPT-VL by 96 h. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that recovery after exercise-induced muscle damage took longer in OC-FOL, followed by NOC-OV and by NOC-FOL, respectively. Furthermore, testosterone and progesterone levels may affect recovery of indirect markers of muscle damage in women.","10.1007/s00421-019-04254-y","Adult; Biomarkers; Contraceptives, Oral; Creatine Kinase; Exercise; Female; Hormones; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Menstrual Cycle; Muscle, Skeletal; Myalgia; Quadriceps Muscle; Saliva","Eccentric cycling; Exercise-induced muscle damage; Muscle recovery; Oral contraception","Journal Article"

SPG4 accounts for about 25% of cases and is caused by mutations in the SPAST gene. Although HSP is an upper motor neuron disease, the relevance of non-motor symptoms is increasingly recognized because of the potential response to treatment. Our study sets out to evaluate non-motor symptoms and their relevance with regard to health-related quality of life. In 118 genetically confirmed SPG4 cases and age- and gender-matched controls, validated questionnaires were used to evaluate fatigue, depression, pain, and restless legs syndrome. In addition, self-reported medical information was collected concerning comorbidities and bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. In a sub-study, cognition was evaluated using the CANTAB® test-battery and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in 26 SPG4 patients. We found depression and pain to be significantly increased. The frequency of restless legs syndrome varied largely depending on defining criteria. There were no significant deficits in cognition as examined by CANTAB® despite a significant increase in self-reported memory impairment in SPG4 patients.

Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has been found to alleviate ED caused by cavernous nerve injury (CNI) in rats. However, little is known about whether induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSC) have a therapeutic effect on CNI ED. We established an ED model on rats and evaluated the effect of iMSC on it. Methods: Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to four groups and received following operation: sham operation (sham group); bilateral CNI and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections (PBS group); bilateral CNI and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation (adMSC group); or bilateral CNI and iMSC injection (iMSC group). After therapy, the cavernous nerve was stimulated by electricity and the intracavernous pressure (IAP)/mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was measured. The endothelial and smooth muscle tissue in the penis was assessed histologically with Masson's trichrome stain. Immunofluorescence/immunohistochemical stains were applied for the detection of nNOS, vWF, eNOS, SMA, Desmin, S100β, and caspase-3. Nude rats CNI ED model was established for the evaluation of iMSC longevity and differentiation capacity. The paracrine factors were assessed by real-time PCR. Results: Transplantation of iMSC significantly restored the IAP/MAP in this CNI ED model and showed long-term effects. It could rescue the expression of vWF, eNOS, SMA, and Desmin, which indicated the alleviation of endothelial and smooth muscle tissues of the penis. iMSC therapy also could increase the expression of nNOS in the cavernosum and S100β in the major pelvic ganglia (MPG) which contributed to the erectile function. Moreover, the level of BAX and caspase-3 were reduced and Bcl-2 was increased, which indicated the anti-apoptosis effects of iMSC. The iMSC showed little transdifferentiation and exerted their function by activating the secretome of the host. Conclusion: Transplantation of iMSC significantly improved ED induced by CNI. The iMSC may exert their effects via paracrine factors and may be a promising therapeutic candidate for treating CNI ED in the future.","10.7150/thno.34008","Animals; Cell Transdifferentiation; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Muscle, Smooth; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit","cavernous nerve injury; cell therapy; erectile dysfunction; induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cell","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was. METHODS: To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers. RESULTS: 2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met the eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R0 (basic reproductive number), and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barré Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%), and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%), and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions, and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail to allow complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median of 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.","10.1371/journal.pntd.0007451","Databases, Factual; Disease Outbreaks; Forecasting; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Public Health; Reproducibility of Results; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Systematic Review"

The goal of this research is to investigate the contribution of intraoperative neuromonitorisation method (IONM) on postoperative erectile function in patients who underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) with the localise prostate cancer (LPCa). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomised controlled study contains 88 patients with LPCa were classified based on D'Amico Risk Classification. 61 patients who met the necessary criteria were divided into two groups as neuromonitorisation group (n = 30) and control group (n = 31). All patients were operated under general anaesthesia. All patients included in the study underwent RALP by robotic-assisted system. For the neuromonitorisation, IONM electromyography electrodes were placed to the right and left cavernous bodies in neuromonitorisation group. Impulses in the corpora cavernosa were considered significant. Postoperative erectile functions were determined according to the 3th and 6th month IIEF-5 scores. Demographic data, operative procedures, Gleason scores, final pathology, surgery border, PSA, and IIEF-5 score of patients were recorded. RESULTS: No statistically difference was found between the groups in terms of demographic data, operative procedures, Gleason scores, final pathology, surgery border, and third-month PSA levels (p > 0.05). There was statistically difference between the postoperative third and 6-month IIEF-5 score in neuromonitorisation group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In the IONM technique, high rate of improvement in erectile function was observed in the early period thanks to personalised neuroprotective surgery applied to patients.","10.1007/s11255-019-02295-y","Aged; Electromyography; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Organ Sparing Treatments; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Peripheral Nerves; Prospective Studies; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Severity of Illness Index","Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy; Neuromonitoring; Neuroprotective surgery; Robotic-assisted","Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial"

Much research continues in attempts to improve outcomes after peripheral nerve damage and to promote nerve repair after injury. In recent years, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been studied as a potential method of stimulating peripheral nerve regeneration. In this review, the physiology of peripheral nerve regeneration is reviewed, and the experiments employing LIPUS to improve peripheral nerve regeneration are discussed. Application of LIPUS following nerve surgery may promote nerve regeneration and improve functional outcomes through a variety of proposed mechanisms. These include an increase of neurotrophic factors, Schwann cell (SC) activation, cellular signaling activations, and induction of mitosis. We searched PubMed for articles related to these topics in both in vitro and in vivo animal research models. We found numerous studies, suggesting that LIPUS following nerve surgery promotes nerve regeneration and improves functional outcomes.

Sex hormone levels are commonly abnormal in men with obesity and this abnormality is often the focus of management in clinical practice. The role of small fibre neuropathy in obesity-related sexual dysfunction is not well established. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the relationship between sexual function, sex hormone levels and small nerve fibre morphology in men with severe obesity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study of 29 men with severe obesity was undertaken. Sexual function was assessed using the European Male Ageing Study Sexual Function Questionnaire. Small nerve fibre morphology was quantified using corneal confocal microscopy. Sex hormone levels were measured by mass spectrophotometry. RESULTS: Erectile dysfunction was present in 72% of the cohort with a higher prevalence of diabetes among the symptomatic group (88% vs 38%, p = 0.006). Corneal nerve fibre length (CNFL) and corneal nerve fibre density (CNFD) were both significantly lower in participants with erectile dysfunction compared to those without (p = 0.039 and p = 0.048 respectively). The erectile function score correlated with CNFL (r = -0.418, p = 0.034) and CNFD (r = -0.411, p = 0.037). Total testosterone and calculated free testosterone levels did not differ significantly between men with or without erectile dysfunction (median 8.8 nmol/L vs 9.0 nmol/L, p = 0.914; and median 176 pmol/L vs 179 pmol/L, p = 0.351 respectively), infrequent sexual thoughts (median 8.1 nmol/L vs 9.2 nmol/L, p = 0.650; and median 184 pmol/L, vs 176 pmol/L, p = 0.619 respectively) and decreased morning erections (median 9.0 nmol/L vs 8.8 nmol/L, p = 0.655; and median 170 pmol/L vs 193 pmol/L, p = 0.278 respectively). CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent in men with severe obesity. We found an association between small fibre neuropathy with erectile dysfunction with presence of diabetes a likely a significant contributing factor. We found no associations between testosterone levels with sexual symptoms (including frequency of sexual thoughts). The influence of small nerve fibre neuropathy on response to therapeutic interventions and whether interventions that improve small fibre neuropathy can improve erectile function in this population merits further study.","10.1371/journal.pone.0221992","Adult; Erectile Dysfunction; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Microscopy, Confocal; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Small Fiber Neuropathy; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Allodynia is associated with poor prognosis, but the impacts on roles, activities, social relationships, and intimacy remain unclear. There is a need to examine intimacy in complex regional pain syndrome from a lived experience perspective. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of cognitive debriefing interview data from 44 persons with complex regional pain syndrome who completed a patient-reported questionnaire. Using interpretive description and thematic analysis, we analyzed items and responses addressing allodynia, relationships, and intimacy. RESULTS: Two themes were developed to understand intimacy related to the pain experience: a renegotiated social identity and participation and a reinvented intimate self. These themes included elements of a) loss of control, b) loss of shared experiences, c) feeling that their condition was misunderstood, d) a need for self-preservation, e) altered self-concept, and e) the concept of intimacy is broader than sexuality. Our findings suggest that complex regional pain syndrome has pervasive impacts on relationships and intimacy that merit discussion with their health care team.

It is essential for emergency clinicians to be aware of how to effectively diagnose and manage this condition. OBJECTIVE: This article provides a narrative review of the diagnosis and management of CES for the emergency clinician. DISCUSSION: Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but emergent condition associated with back pain. It can result in severe morbidity and can be due to a variety of causes, most commonly vertebral disc protrusion. Diagnosis is often delayed, which may result in a poor prognosis. Red flags and findings consistent with CES include bilateral neurogenic sciatica, reduced perineal sensation, altered bladder function leading to painless urinary retention, loss of anal tone, and loss of sexual function. In isolation, history and examination findings demonstrate poor sensitivity. Symptoms may occur either suddenly or gradually, and most patients do not present with all of these symptoms. Postvoid bladder volume assessments can assist in the evaluation, but the diagnosis typically involves magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography myelography if MRI is not available. Treatment relies upon surgical consultation and operative intervention for decompression. CONCLUSION: Cauda equina syndrome can be a difficult diagnosis. However, knowledge of the history and examination findings, imaging, and treatment can assist the emergency clinician in optimizing management of this condition.","10.1016/j.ajem.2019.158402","Back Pain; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Delayed Diagnosis; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Sensation Disorders; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Spinal Cord; Urinary Bladder; Urination Disorders","Back pain; Cauda equina syndrome; Incontinence; Neurologic deficit","Journal Article; Review"

METHODS: We performed a review of the literature, screening for randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective series, position papers, and guidelines on urinary and sexual dysfunction in ATTR patients published in PubMed and Embase. RESULTS: Lower urinary tract dysfunction is present in up to 83% of patients with ATTR. Voiding symptoms are the most common, reported in 34.8-87.5% of patients, while urinary tract infections are reported in up to 50%. Urinary incontinence is observed in 16.7-37.5% of the ATTR population, mostly due to decreased urethral resistance. Sexual dysfunction affects over 40% of ATTR patients, with erectile dysfunction and sexual arousal disorder being the most common symptoms in male and female patients, respectively. In addition to a thorough clinical examination, invasive pressure-flow urodynamic testing is a cornerstone in the assessment of ATTR lower urinary tract dysfunction. The most common finding is detrusor underactivity and intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Poor bladder compliance can also be observed in patients, due to amyloid deposits on the bladder wall. Urinary tract imaging may be of interest to rule out upper urinary tract deterioration. Given the paucity of data in the ATTR population, treatment should be tailored to the individual patient. CONCLUSION: Urinary and sexual dysfunction are highly prevalent in ATTR patients. Comprehensive assessment and multidisciplinary management are keys to avoiding upper urinary tract damage and improving patients' quality of life.","10.1007/s10286-019-00627-7","Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial; Humans; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Urologic Diseases","Detrusor underactivity; Familial amyloidosis polyneuropathy type 1; Lower urinary tract dysfunction; Sexual dysfunction; TTR amyloidosis","Journal Article; Review"

In addition, these studies rely on patient descriptions of the presence or absence of symptoms, with no gradation of severity. This study aimed to assess long-term bladder, bowel, sexual and physical function using validated questionnaires in a CES cohort. METHODS: A pre-existing ethically approved database was used to identify patients who had undergone surgery for CES between August 2013 and November 2014. Patients were contacted over a 1-month period between August and September 2017 and completed validated questionnaires via telephone, assessing bladder (Urinary Symptom Profile), bowel (Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score), sexual dysfunction (Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale) and physical function (Physical Component Summary of SF-12 Questionnaire), with scores compared between those presenting with incomplete CES (CES-I) and CES with retention (CES-R). Patients were also asked which of their symptoms currently they would most value treatment for and what healthcare services they had accessed post-operatively. RESULTS: Forty-six of 77 patients (response rate 72%, inclusion rate 60%) with a mean age of 45 years (21-83) and mean time since admission of 43 months (range 36-60) took part in the follow-up study. The prevalence of bladder dysfunction was 76%, bowel dysfunction 13%, sexual dysfunction 39% and physical dysfunction 48%. Patients presenting with CES-R had significantly worse long-term outcomes in bladder (stream domain), bowel and sexual function in compared to those with CES-I. Pain was chosen as the symptom patients would most value treatment for by 57%, but only 7% reported post-operative pain management referral. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean follow-up time of 43 months, these findings confirm the high prevalence of long-term bladder, sexual and physical dysfunction in CES patients and that a diagnosis of CES-R confers poorer outcomes.

METHODS: Sixty 12-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were categorized into 4 groups: (1) Sham-surgery (Sham) group, (2) CN-crush-injury (CNCI), (3) CNCI group (CNCI+L+1.0J) treated with a combination of 10.0 mg/kg LIMK2-inhibitors and low-dose (1.0 mg/kg) JNK-inhibitors, and (4) CNCI group (CNCI+L+10.0J) treated with a combination of 10.0 mg/kg LIMK2-inhibitors and a high dose (10.0 mg/kg) of JNK-inhibitors. Ten days after surgery, erectile response, histological-studies, and Western-blot was investigated. RESULTS: The CNCI group showed a reduced maximal ICP/MAP or AUC/MAP, decreased immunohistochemical-staining of α-SMA, decreased SM/collagen ratio, increased phospho-cJun-positive apoptotic cells, increased phospho-LIMK2-positive fibroblasts, increased cJun-phosphorylation, increased LIMK2/Cofilin-phosphorylation, decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and increased protein-expression of fibronectin, compared to the Sham group. Both the CNCI+L+1.0J and CNCI+L+10.0J groups showed improvements in erectile-responses, content of cavernosal α-SMA, number of phospho-cJun-positive apoptotic cells, Bcl-2/Bax ratio and cJun phosphorylation. Their improvements in the CNCI+L+10.0J group showed a tendency to be greater than those in the CNCI+L+1.0J group. Also, in the 2 treatment groups, rectification of SM/collagen ratio, number of phospho-LIMK2-positive fibroblasts, LIMK2/Cofilin-phosphorylation, and protein-expression of fibronectin was observed. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that combined inhibition of JNK and LIMK2 may improve erectile function by suppressing cavernosal apoptosis and fibrosis via restoration of cJun/Bcl-2/Bax and LIMK2/Cofilin pathways at 10 days after CN injury.","10.1016/j.urology.2019.06.005","Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Combinations; Erectile Dysfunction; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Lim Kinases; Male; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","","Journal Article"

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 131 children or adolescents treated with statins for familial hypercholesterolemia were prospectively included. The efficacy of treatment was established by the percentage of children who achieved low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels <160 mg/dL during treatment. Treatment tolerance was evaluated by the occurrence of clinical or laboratory side effects, regularity of increases in height and weight, and pubertal development. RESULTS: The median duration of treatment with statins was 4 years. A median decrease of 32% in LDL-C levels was observed (P < .0001). The therapeutic target (LDL-C <160 mg/dL) was achieved in 67% of cases. Increases in height and weight and sexual maturation were not affected by the treatment. Minor side effects were reported for 24 (18.4%) patients including 3 cases of a clinically asymptomatic increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, 2 cases of an increase in CPK levels with muscular symptoms, 14 cases of myalgia without an increase in CPK levels, 3 cases of abdominal pain, 1 case of dysuria, and 1 case of diffuse pain. None of these side effects led to the discontinuation of statin therapy, although a change of statin was required in 7 cases. This new statin was tolerated in all cases. No patients had abnormal liver function during treatment.

A further 2 month period was then re-audited. 120 patients in total were included across both time periods. Chi-squared was used to compare documentation rates between time periods. RESULTS: 25 of 120 patients had radiological cauda equina compression. Lower limb neurology, urinary function and saddle sensation were almost universally documented. After the intervention, there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the documentation of bowel function and post-void residual but not sexual function. Sexual function was poorly documented with rates of 3% and 11% throughout the two audited periods. CONCLUSION: Certain clinical features of CES are well documented. Increasing awareness may improve documentation of certain symptoms/signs in patients with suspected cauda equina syndrome. Sexual function was poorly documented and increasing awareness alone is an inadequate intervention.","10.1016/j.surge.2019.03.005","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Awareness; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Sexuality; Young Adult","Cauda equina syndrome; Documentation; Lumbar disc herniation; Outcomes; Sexual function","Journal Article"

AIM: To determine the pharmacokinetic and adverse event profile of diazepam vaginal suppositories. METHODS: We used a prospective pharmacokinetic design with repeated assessments of diazepam levels. Eight healthy volunteers were administered a 10-mg compounded vaginal diazepam suppository in the outpatient gynecologic clinic. Serum samples were collected at 0, 45, 90, 120, and 180 minutes; 8, 24, and 72 hours; and 1 week following administration of a 10-mg vaginal suppository. The occurrence of adverse events was assessed using the alternate step and tandem walk tests, the Brief Confusion Assessment Method, and numerical ratings. Plasma concentrations of diazepam and active long-acting metabolites were measured. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by standard noncompartmental methods. RESULTS: The mean peak diazepam concentration (Cmax) of 31.0 ng/mL was detected at a mean time (Tmax) of 3.1 hours after suppository placement. The bioavailability was found to be 70.5%, and the mean terminal elimination half-life was 82 hours. The plasma levels of temazepam and nordiazepam peaked at 0.8 ng/mL at 29 hours and 6.4 ng/mL at 132 hours, respectively. Fatigue was reported by 3 of 8 participants. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Serum plasma concentrations of vaginally administered diazepam are low; however the half-life is prolonged. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths include use of inclusion and exclusion criteria aimed at mitigating clinical factors that could adversely impact diazepam absorption and metabolism, and the use of an ultrasensitive LC-MS/MS assay. Limitations included the lack of addressing the efficacy of vaginal diazepam in lieu of performing a pure pharmacokinetic study with healthy participants. CONCLUSION: Vaginal administration of diazepam results in lower peak serum plasma concentration, longer time to peak concentration, and lower bioavailability than standard oral use. Providers should be aware that with diazepam's long half-life, accumulating levels would occur with chronic daily doses, and steady-state levels would not be reached for up to 1 week. This profile would favor intermittent use to allow participation in physical therapy and intimacy. Larish AM, Dickson RR, Kudgus RA, et al.

Additionally, it will highlight the mechanism of nerve injury and regeneration as well as similarities and differences between RES and current electrical stimulation treatments in urology, functional electrical stimulation (FES) and neuromodulation. RECENT FINDINGS: It has been demonstrated that RES upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor to facilitate neuroregeneration, facilitating accurate reinnervation of muscles by motoneurons. Further, RES upregulates growth factors in glial cells. Within the past 2 years, RES of the pudendal nerve upregulated BDNF in Onuf's nucleus, the cell bodies of motoneurons that course through the pudendal nerve and accelerated functional recovery in an animal model of stress urinary incontinence. Additionally, electrical stimulation of the vaginal tissue in an animal model of stress urinary incontinence accelerated functional recovery. SUMMARY: RES has great potential but future research is needed to expand the potential beneficial effects of RES in the field of urology.","10.1097/MOU.0000000000000632","Animals; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Male Urogenital Diseases; Models, Animal; Nerve Regeneration; Peripheral Nerve Injuries","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Review"

TECHNIQUE: We dissected 4 cases of cadavers, mainly focusing on anatomy of Denonvilliers' fascia, to study the relationship between Denonvilliers' fascia and rectum. In practice, instead of dissection 1 cm above peritoneal reflection, dissection of the peritoneum was performed at the lowest level of peritoneal reflection during laparoscopic resection for mid-low rectal cancer. RESULTS: The cadaveric study revealed that there were loose tissues between Denonvilliers' fascia and rectal specimen, thus a surgical plane posterior to Denonvilliers' fascia did exist. During laparoscopic resection for mid-low rectal cancer, some loose reticulate structures between Denonvilliers' fascia and proper fascia of rectum would present after dissection of peritoneum at the lowest level of peritoneal reflection. Then dissection within the surgical plane posterior to Denonvilliers' fascia became easy and feasible. In this plane, both the pelvic nerves and postoperative urogenital function could be well protected by Denonvilliers' fascia. CONCLUSIONS: The anterior surgical plane for total mesorectal excision should be reconsidered, and dissection posterior to Denonvilliers' fascia is feasible and practicable for patients without risk of positive anterior circumferential resection margin.","10.1097/DCR.0000000000001358","Autonomic Pathways; Cadaver; Erectile Dysfunction; Fascia; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Mesentery; Pelvis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Postoperative Complications; Proctectomy; Rectal Neoplasms; Rectum; Urination Disorders","","Journal Article"
"30896247","Acupuncture for symptoms management in Korean breast cancer survivors: a prospective pilot study.","Kim TH; Kang JW","Acupuncture in medicine : journal of the British Medical Acupuncture Society","2019","BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for effective treatment of the various treatment-related symptoms experienced by breast cancer survivors. These symptoms could be alleviated by acupuncture. Although several lines of evidence in Western countries suggest that acupuncture has a beneficial effect on symptoms in breast cancer survivors, few relevant studies have been conducted in Korean patients. This pilot study assessed the feasibility of acupuncture for a variety of treatment-related symptoms in Korean breast cancer survivors. METHOD: From October 2015 to March 2016, we recruited patients who had undergone treatment for breast cancer and subsequently reported symptoms, including aromatase inhibitor-related knee pain, vasomotor symptoms, insomnia, sexual dysfunction and post-mastectomy pain in the chest wall or shoulder. The women received 4 weeks of symptom-specific acupuncture followed by a further 4 weeks of follow-up to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture for this indication, and its impact on common and symptom-specific outcome variables. RESULTS: Eight study participants were recruited over a period of 6 months, six of whom completed the planned acupuncture treatment and follow-up assessments. A total of 78 acupuncture sessions were performed. We found that acupuncture was feasible, with only six minor self-limiting acupuncture-related adverse events. Most of the women felt that they had benefitted from participation in the study. The preliminary analysis indicated improvement in common symptom-specific outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that acupuncture is feasible, but low recruitment rates should be considered when considering future acupuncture research in Korean breast cancer survivors. Rigorous evaluation of this symptomatic treatment strategy is now needed in the Korean population.","10.1177/0964528419832610","Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; Neuralgia; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Radiotherapy; Republic of Korea; Survivors; Treatment Outcome","Korea; acupuncture; aromatase inhibitor–related arthralgia; breast cancer survivor; hot flushes; insomnia; post-mastectomy pain; sexual dysfunction","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

However, data concerning other pelvic organs is limited. A large case-control study has therefore been undertaken to determine the presence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and sexual dysfunction in adults with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease. METHODS: Adults with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease and control subjects were recruited from a specialist mitochondrial clinic. The presence and severity of LUTS and their impact on quality of life, in addition to sexual dysfunction and bowel symptoms, were captured using four validated questionnaires. Subgroup analysis was undertaken in patients harbouring the m.3243A>G MT-TL1 mitochondrial DNA mutation. A subset of patients underwent urodynamic studies to further characterize their LUTS. RESULTS: Data from 58 patients and 19 controls (gender and age matched) were collected. Adults with mitochondrial disease had significantly more overactive bladder (81.5% vs. 56.3%, P = 0.039) and low stream (34.5% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.013) urinary symptoms than controls. Urodynamic studies in 10 patients confirmed that bladder storage symptoms predominate. Despite high rates of LUTS, none of the patient group was receiving treatment. Female patients and those harbouring the m.3243A>G MT-TL1 mutation experienced significantly more sexual dysfunction than controls (53.1% vs. 11.1%, P = 0.026, and 66.7% vs. 26.3%, P = 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Lower urinary tract symptoms are common but undertreated in adult mitochondrial disease, and female patients and those harbouring the m.3243A>G MT-TL1 mutation experience sexual dysfunction. Given their impact on quality of life, screening for and treating LUTS and sexual dysfunction in adults with mitochondrial disease are strongly recommended.","10.1111/ene.13952","Adult; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms; Male; Middle Aged; Mitochondrial Diseases; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires","bladder symptoms; bowel symptoms; lower gastrointestinal tract symptoms; lower urinary tract symptoms; mitochondrial disease; sexual dysfunction; urogenital symptoms","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Forty-two 12-week-old rats were equally categorized into the three groups: sham-surgery (S), CNCI (I), and CNCI treated with LIMK2-inhibitors (L). The L-group was treated with daily intraperitoneal injection of LIMK2-inhibitors (10.0 mg/kg) for 30-days after surgery. Erectile function was assessed using dynamic-infusion-cavernosometry (DIC). Penile tissue was processed for Masson's-trichrome staining, Western-blotting, and double immunofluorescence. The I-group showed significantly higher maintenance and drop rates as well as lower papaverine response, compared to the S-group. Chronic inhibition of LIMK2 in the L-group significantly improved the DIC parameters compared to those in the I-group, although the parameters were not completely restored to normal control values. Also, the I-group showed a reduced smooth muscle (SM)-to-collagen ratio, decreased immunohistochemical staining for α-SM-actin, increased number of fibroblasts positive for phosphorylated Cofilin, increased LIMK2/Cofilin phosphorylation and increased protein expression of Collagen-1 or Fibronectin, compared to the S-group. The L-group showed significant improvements in SM/collagen ratio and the deposition of Collagen-1 or Fibronectin compared to the I-group, although not completely normalized. According to the densitometry and confocal microscopy results, the L-group showed restoration of LIMK2/Cofilin phosphorylation and amount of fibroblasts positive for phosphorylated Cofilin to the normal control value.

Rats in Groups I + L, I + U, and I + L + U were treated with respective regimens for 2 weeks after CNCI. At 2 weeks after surgery, erectile response was assessed using electrostimulation. Penile tissues were processed for histological studies and western blot. Group I showed lower intracavernous pressure (ICP)/mean arterial pressure (MAP), lower area under the curve (AUC)/MAP, decreased immunohistochemical staining for alpha-smooth muscle (SM) actin, higher apoptotic index, lower SM/collagen ratio, increased phospho-LIMK2-positive fibroblasts, decreased protein kinase B/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (Akt/eNOS) phosphorylation, increased LIMK2/cofilin phosphorylation, and increased protein expression of fibronectin, compared to Group S. In all three treatment groups, erectile responses, protein expression of fibronectin, and SM/collagen ratio were improved. Group I + L + U showed greater improvement in erectile response than Group I + L. SM content and apoptotic index in Groups I + U and I + L + U were improved compared to those in Group I. However, Group I + L did not show a significant improvement in SM content or apoptotic index. The number of phospho-LIMK2-positive fibroblasts was normalized in Groups I + L and I + L + U, but not in Group I + U.

This provides an unprecedented opportunity to directly observe prodromal neurodegenerative states, and potentially intervene with neuroprotective therapy. For future neuroprotective trials, it is essential to accurately estimate phenoconversion rate and identify potential predictors of phenoconversion. This study assessed the neurodegenerative disease risk and predictors of neurodegeneration in a large multicentre cohort of iRBD. We combined prospective follow-up data from 24 centres of the International RBD Study Group. At baseline, patients with polysomnographically-confirmed iRBD without parkinsonism or dementia underwent sleep, motor, cognitive, autonomic and special sensory testing. Patients were then prospectively followed, during which risk of dementia and parkinsonsim were assessed. The risk of dementia and parkinsonism was estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Predictors of phenoconversion were assessed with Cox proportional hazards analysis, adjusting for age, sex, and centre. Sample size estimates for disease-modifying trials were calculated using a time-to-event analysis. Overall, 1280 patients were recruited. The average age was 66.3 ± 8.4 and 82.5% were male. Average follow-up was 4.6 years (range = 1-19 years). The overall conversion rate from iRBD to an overt neurodegenerative syndrome was 6.3% per year, with 73.5% converting after 12-year follow-up. The rate of phenoconversion was significantly increased with abnormal quantitative motor testing [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.16], objective motor examination (HR = 3.03), olfactory deficit (HR = 2.62), mild cognitive impairment (HR = 1.91-2.37), erectile dysfunction (HR = 2.13), motor symptoms (HR = 2.11), an abnormal DAT scan (HR = 1.98), colour vision abnormalities (HR = 1.69), constipation (HR = 1.67), REM atonia loss (HR = 1.54), and age (HR = 1.54). There was no significant predictive value of sex, daytime somnolence, insomnia, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnoea, urinary dysfunction, orthostatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, or hyperechogenicity on substantia nigra ultrasound. Among predictive markers, only cognitive variables were different at baseline between those converting to primary dementia versus parkinsonism. Sample size estimates for definitive neuroprotective trials ranged from 142 to 366 patients per arm. This large multicentre study documents the high phenoconversion rate from iRBD to an overt neurodegenerative syndrome. Our findings provide estimates of the relative predictive value of prodromal markers, which can be used to stratify patients for neuroprotective trials.","10.1093/brain/awz030","Aged; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Disease Progression; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lewy Body Disease; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; Polysomnography; Prodromal Symptoms; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; REM Sleep Behavior Disorder; Risk Factors","Parkinson’s disease; REM sleep behaviour disorder; dementia with Lewy bodies; multiple system atrophy","Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

METHODS: Cancer survivors with persistent CIPN after completion of platinum and/or taxane chemotherapy completed CIPN questionnaires (severity, interference with activities, sensory, and motor symptoms) and objective testing (light touch, vibration, pain, cold sensation). CIPN measures were compared by age group (< 65 n = 260 versus ≥ 65 n = 165) using parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Among 425 cancer survivors with CIPN, mean age was 60.9 (SD 10.5). CIPN location did not differ by age (overall 68% hands and feet, 27% only feet, 5% only hands). For patient-reported measures, older survivors reported less severe pain in the hands and feet than younger survivors. In addition, older survivors reported lower interference with general activity, routine activities, normal work, enjoyment of life, sleep, mood, relations with other people, and sexual activity. No age differences in sensory and motor symptom scores were found. In contrast, for objective measures, older survivors had worse light touch and cold sensations in their feet and worse vibration detection in their hands and feet. CONCLUSIONS: Despite having worse light touch, cold, and vibration sensations, older cancer survivors with CIPN reported less severe pain and interference with activities. This discordance highlights the importance of including both patient-reported and objective measures to assess CIPN in cancer survivors to better evaluate this clinical condition.","10.1007/s00520-019-04695-3","Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Bridged-Ring Compounds; Cancer Survivors; Female; Humans; Induction Chemotherapy; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Pain; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Platinum; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taxoids","Age; Cancer survivor; Chemotherapy; Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy; Patient-reported outcomes","Journal Article"

Psychological distress is a significant risk factor for the development of chronic pain and has been found to affect the outcome of SCS. Childhood trauma is a risk factor for chronic pain, but has not previously been studied in SCS patients. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this prospective registry-based study was to investigate the prevalence of 5 domains of childhood trauma (emotional neglect, emotional abuse, physical neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse) and their relationship with the outcome of spinal cord stimulation on patients suffering from treatment-resistant chronic pain. METHODS: SCS patients treated at Kuopio University Hospital between 1/1/2015 and 12/31/2016 were sent a survey in the mail, the Trauma and Distress Scale, assessing childhood trauma (n = 43). Neuropathic pain, disability, anxiety, and depression were measured in the patients pre-surgery and at 6 and 12 months post-surgery. The patients who provided their name on the questionnaire (n = 22) and had suffered from 3 or more domains of trauma were grouped as the high-trauma group (n = 13) and the rest as the low-trauma group (n = 9). RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 40 patients (93%). At least 1 domain of trauma was experienced by 35 (88%) patients, and at least 2 by 24 (60%). The low-trauma group displayed a statistically significant decrease in the mean PainDETECT score from 21.5 before SCS to 16.5 at 12 months post-surgery (Wilk's lambda = 0.297, F(2,9) = 10.6, P = 0.004), contrary to the high- trauma group (Wilk's lambda = 0.904, F(2,6) = 0.3, P = 0.739). LIMITATIONS: Only 22 of the 40 patients provided their name on the questionnaire, which decreased the sample size on follow-up. CONCLUSION: This was the first study to investigate childhood trauma in SCS patients. Patients who had experienced high amounts of childhood trauma did not experience any relief from neuropathic pain 12 months' post-SCS, contrary to the low-trauma group. Childhood trauma might be a factor worth screening in the preoperative evaluation and aftercare of SCS candidates.

METHODS: The study included all patients referred in our neuro-urology department and who suffered from radicular pain before, during or after micturition, defecation and/or orgasm. Data included demographic and medical variables, urodynamic and perineal electromyographic diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (men: 70%, mean age 45.4 ± 11.8,) complained of radicular pain before, during or after orgasm (51.4%), micturition (34.3%), or defecation (14.3%). In 30% of cases, radiculopathy was found and was predicted by micturition pain. Other pathologies were as follows: vertebral (16.5%), pelvis and sacral (16.5%), inflammatory central nervous system (10%) lesions and peripheral neuropathies (6.7%). Neurological level of injury was between the lumbar and the sacral level. All spinal cord lesions were lesions of the conus medullaris. Patients also complained of lower urinary tract symptoms (70%), sexual (63.3%) and bowel (60%) disorders. In most cases, the urodynamic diagnosis was neurogenic bladder with peripheral abnormalities and the electromyographic diagnosis was distal neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Radicular pain occurring during micturition, defecation or orgasm is a rare condition. The most common underlying lesion seems to be radiculopathy, from lumbar to sacral spine. The presence of these symptoms, in the absence of any known neurological condition, should suggest the practitioner a radiculopathy in most of the cases. In consequence, appropriate additional tests should be offered to these patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Few data are available on sciatica during micturition, defecation or orgasm. This study underlines the need for appropriate tests if a patient complaint from this type of symptom. Indeed, the most common underlying lesion is a radiculopathy but can also be a lesion of conus medullaris.","10.1002/ejp.1372","Adult; Back Pain; Cohort Studies; Defecation; Female; Humans; Lumbosacral Region; Male; Middle Aged; Orgasm; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Radiculopathy; Sciatica; Spinal Cord; Urinary Bladder; Urination","","Journal Article"

Therefore, revealing the characteristics of Schwann cells will be essential in understanding peripheral neurodegeneration-related diseases for which there is currently no effective treatment. Trichostatin A (TSA) is a noncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs have been shown not only to deacetylate histones but also to target non-histone proteins involved in diverse signaling pathways. Recent studies have revealed that diverse HDAC subtypes regulate peripheral neurodegeneration. Thus, regulating HDAC levels could be an effective strategy for the development of drugs targeting peripheral nerve-related diseases. In fact, the use of TSA has been investigated for the treatment of many diseases, including degenerative diseases of the central nervous system; however, the effects of TSA on peripheral neurodegeneration have not yet been well established. In this study, we revealed the effect of TSA on the process of peripheral neurodegeneration. TSA successfully inhibited myelin fragmentation, axonal degradation, and trans-dedifferentiation and proliferation of Schwann cells, which are essential phenotypes in peripheral neurodegeneration. Therefore, TSA could be a potential drug for patients suffering from peripheral neurodegeneration-related diseases.","10.1007/s10735-019-09815-1","Axons; Cell Dedifferentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Hydroxamic Acids; Myelin Sheath; Nerve Degeneration; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Schwann Cells","Acetylation; Axonal degradation; Demyelination; Histone deacetylases; Schwann cells; Trichostatin A","Journal Article"

This can result in bowel, bladder and sexual dysfunction plus lower limb weakness, numbness and pain. CES occurs infrequently, but has serious potential morbidity and medicolegal consequences. This study aims to identify and describe the presentation and management of patients with CES in the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Understanding Cauda Equina Syndrome (UCES) is a prospective and collaborative multicentre cohort study of adult patients with confirmed CES managed at specialist spinal centres in the UK. Participants will be identified using neurosurgical and orthopaedic trainee networks to screen referrals to spinal centres. Details of presentation, investigations, management and service usage will be recorded. Both patient-reported and clinician-reported outcome measures will be assessed for 1 year after surgery. This will establish the incidence of CES, current investigation and management practices, and adherence to national standards of care. Outcomes will be stratified by clinical presentation and patient management. Accurate and up to date information about the presentation, management and outcome of patients with CES will inform standards of service design and delivery for this important but infrequent condition. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: UCES received a favourable ethical opinion from the South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee 02 (Reference: 18/SS/0047; IRAS ID: 233515). All spinal centres managing patients with CES in the UK will be encouraged to participate in UCES. Study results will be published in medical journals and shared with local participating sites.

The following were the key terms: 'sexual' OR 'sexuality' OR 'intimacy' OR 'marital' AND 'ALS' OR 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis' OR 'Motor Neuron Disease' OR 'MND'. Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance and a full-text analysis was performed on the selected articles. Studies were included if they referred to sexual well-being/activities/functions or intimate relationship between patients and their partners and management of such topic by clinicians. Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers. A thematic and level of evidence classification of studies was performed. Studies' design, objectives, measurements and outcomes were summarised. Thirty articles were included and four topics were identified: intimacy in the dyads; sexual activities in patients and with their partners; sexual function disturbances; and sexuality and cognitive-behavioural alterations. The quality of the studies varies, with globally poor level of evidence. Some sexuality issues have been only sparsely addressed, such as gender-related differences, same-sex relationships and sexual activities other than intercourse. Sexuality in ALS is still not adequately considered by clinicians and researchers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dual NVED model was established in athymic rats by crushing the bilateral cavernous nerves and ligating the bilateral internal pudendal neurovascular bundles. At the time of defect creation, three different types of human cell populations (2.5 × 106  cells/0.2 mL: umbilical vein endothelial cells, adipose-derived stem cells, and amniotic fluid-derived stem cells) were injected intracavernously into the penile tissue. Saline injection (0.2 mL) served as a control group. Erectile function and histomorphological analyses of penile tissues were assessed 12 weeks after defect creation and cell or saline injection. RESULTS: The ratio of intracavernous pressure to mean arterial pressure (functional indicator) was significantly higher in the cell therapy groups compared to the saline-injected control group (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence staining showed more cells expressing biomarkers of endothelial, smooth muscle, and nerve cells within the penile tissue in the cell therapy groups when compared to the control group.

Focus on alleviating such disparities centers on diagnosis, treatment, and mortality. This review surveyed current knowledge of health disparities that exist in the acute survivorship period (immediately following diagnosis and treatment) and their contributors, particularly for African-American breast cancer survivors (AA-BCS). METHODS: Utilizing the ASCO four components of survivorship care, we explore disparities in surveillance and effects of cancer and therapies that AA-BCS face within the acute survivorship period (the years immediately following diagnosis). A literature review of PUBMED, Scopus, and Cochrane databases was conducted to identify articles related to AA-BCS acute survivorship. The search yielded 97 articles. Of the 97 articles, 38 articles met inclusion criteria. RESULTS: AA-BCS experience disparate survivorship care, which negatively impacts quality of life and health outcomes. Challenges exist in surveillance, interventions for late effects (e.g., quality-of-life outcomes, cardiotoxicity, and cognitive changes), preventing recurrence with promotion of healthy living, and coordinating care among the healthcare team. CONCLUSIONS: This overview identified current knowledge on the challenges in survivorship among AA-BCS. Barriers to optimal survivorship care inhibit progress in eliminating breast cancer disparities. Research addressing best practices for survivorship care is needed for this population. Implementation of culturally tailored care may reduce breast cancer disparities among AA-BCS.","10.1007/s00520-018-4545-y","Adult; Black or African American; Aftercare; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Cognition Disorders; Communication; Diet; Exercise; Female; Fertility Preservation; Health Status Disparities; Heart Diseases; Humans; Mammaplasty; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Professional-Patient Relations; Quality of Life; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","Acute survivorship; African-American; Breast cancer; Cultural competence; Health disparities","Journal Article; Review"

It leads to considerable functional impairment. Most previous studies focused on male samples. The study aimed to validate a German version of the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory (MDDI) in order to make the instrument available in German speaking countries. We further aimed to explore for gender differences in the MDDI factors (measurement invariance) and to assess the relationship between MD and positive dimensions of body experience as well as exercise dependence. 394 participants (53% females, mean age 24.3 years) took part in an internet-based survey. The three-factor structure of the English version of the MDDI was replicated, independent of gender (multi group CFA; Base model TLI = .961; CFI = .970). Cronbach´s alpha was .81-.84 for the subscales and .75 for the MDDI total score. MD was associated with exercise dependence and negatively correlated with dimensions of positive body experience, which can be considered relevant for satisfying relationships and a positive sense of self: e.g. body contact and sexual fulfillment. Men and women showed differences in two subscales of the MDDI (appearance intolerance, drive for size). Testing for measurement invariance resulted in weak invariance: Equivalent factor structure for men and women, but significantly different loadings and coefficients. No statistically significant difference in the MDDI total score was found. The findings suggest good psychometric properties of the German version of the MDDI. Future studies should address the question of cut-off scores and norms for different samples as well as a possible overlap between MD and eating disorder psychopathology in women.","10.1371/journal.pone.0207535","Adult; Exercise; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Muscular Diseases; Sex Characteristics","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Complex regional pain syndrome exhibits autoimmune features in part mediated by autoantibodies against muscarinic-2 acetylcholine (M2) receptor. The mechanisms underlying the M2 receptor involvement in complex regional pain syndrome remain obscure. Based on our recent work demonstrating that limb nerve trauma releases a potent proalgesic, immunodominant myelin basic protein fragment, our present sequence database analyses reveal an unexpected and previously undescribed structural homology of the proalgesic myelin basic protein fragment with the M2 receptor. As both complex regional pain syndrome and the proalgesic myelin basic protein activity are prevalent in females, this myelin basic protein/M2 homology presents an inviting hypothesis explaining the mechanisms of autoimmune pathogenesis and sexual dimorphism that underlies vulnerability toward developing complex regional pain syndrome and other pain states with neuropathic features. This hypothesis may aid in the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to chronic pain.","10.1177/1744806918815005","Amino Acid Sequence; Autoantibodies; Complex Regional Pain Syndromes; Female; Humans; Male; Myelin Basic Protein; Receptors, Muscarinic; Sex Characteristics; Structural Homology, Protein","Acetylcholine muscarinic receptor; autoimmunity; complex regional pain syndrome; myelin basic protein; pain","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Review"

There is some evidence to suggest that diet has an influence on menopausal symptoms, but less attention has been paid to dietary patterns. The purpose of this study is to determine the association of dietary patterns with physical, mental, and genitourinary menopausal symptoms. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was applied using a sample of 400 postmenopausal women who attended health centers in the south of Tehran, Iran. The menopausal symptoms were assessed by a Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) questionnaire; a 147-item, semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information, and major dietary patterns were identified by principal component analysis. Linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between menopausal symptoms and dietary patterns. RESULTS: Three major dietary patterns were identified: vegetables and fruits (VF); mayonnaise, liquid oils, sweets, and desserts (MLSD); and solid fats and snacks (SFS). It has been found that the VF dietary pattern is inversely associated with general (β = -1.37; SE = 1.08; P for trend <0.001), physical (β = -1.54; SE = 1.09; P for trend <0.001), and mental (β = -1.58; SE = 1.11; P for trend <0.001) symptoms. A stronger adherence to the MLSD dietary pattern was directly associated with general (β = 1.15; SE = 1.08; P for trend <0.001) and genitourinary symptoms (β = 1.54; SE = 1.1; P for trend <0.001). Moreover, the SFS dietary pattern was directly related to the general (β = 1.23; SE = 1.09; P for trend = 0.01), physical (β = 1.24; SE = 1.09; P for trend = 0.04), and mental (β = 1.29; SE = 1.12; P for trend < 0.001) symptoms. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that there is an inverse association between VF dietary pattern and menopausal symptoms. In contrast, the MLSD and SFS dietary patterns were correlated to an increased risk of these symptoms.","10.1097/GME.0000000000001245","Anxiety; Arthralgia; Atrophy; Attention; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Diet; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Exercise; Female; Fruit; Hot Flashes; Humans; Memory Disorders; Menopause; Middle Aged; Myalgia; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Sweating; Vagina; Vegetables","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Understanding these patients aids clinical differentiation and management in CES. METHODS: A retrospective electronic note review was undertaken of patients presenting with suspected CES, defined as ≥ 1 of acute bladder, bowel, sexual dysfunction or saddle numbness, to a regional neurosciences centre. We investigated radiology, clinical features, psychiatric and functional disorder comorbidities and outcome of patients with 'scan-negative' CES and patients with MRI confirmed compression of the cauda equina ('scan-positive' CES). RESULTS: 276 patients were seen over 16 months. There were three main radiologically defined patient groups: (1) 'scan-positive' CES (n = 78, mean age 48 years, 56% female), (2) 'scan-negative' CES without central canal stenosis but with lumbosacral nerve root compression not explaining the clinical presentation (n = 87, mean age 43 years, 68% female) and (3) 'scan-negative' CES without neural compromise (n = 104, mean age 42 years, 70% female). In the two 'scan-negative' groups (no neural compromise and nerve root compression), there were higher rates of functional disorders (37% and 29% vs. 9%), functional neurological disorders (12% and 11% vs 0%) and psychiatric comorbidity (53% and 40% vs 20%). On follow-up (mean 13-16 months), only 1 of the 191 patients with 'scan-negative' CES was diagnosed with an explanatory neurological disorder (transverse myelitis). CONCLUSIONS: The data support a model in which scan-negative cauda equina syndrome arises as an end pathway of acute pain, sometimes with partly structural findings and vulnerability to functional disorders.","10.1007/s00415-018-9078-2","Adult; Aged; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult","Cauda equina syndrome; Chronic pain; Functional neurological disorder; Negative scan; Outcome; Psychogenic","Journal Article"

In addition to its ability to improve the control of hyperglycaemia, metformin has been shown to reduce the burden o,f ageing via effects on damaged DNA and the process of apoptosis. Studies have shown that metformin may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease through influences on body weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and the progression of atherosclerosis. Studies also suggest that metformin may be beneficial for neuro-psychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment and in reducing the risk of dementia, erectile dysfunction and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that metformin has anti-cancer properties, and population studies have suggested that metformin may reduce the risk of cancer or improve cancer prognosis. It is thought that it exerts its anti-cancer effect through the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway. Because of its effect on the mTOR pathway, there may be a role for metformin in slowing or reversing growth of life-threatening hamartomas in tuberous sclerosis complex.","10.1111/bcp.13780","Animals; Blood Glucose; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cell Line, Tumor; Clinical Trials as Topic; Cognition; Depression; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Male; Metformin; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Neoplasms; Prognosis; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss","clinical pharmacology; genetic polymorphism; genetics and pharmacogenetics; neurology; therapeutics","Journal Article; Review"
"30180092","Incidence of Nerve Injury After Hip Arthroscopy.","Kern MJ; Murray RS; Sherman TI; Postma WF","The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons","2018","INTRODUCTION: Hip arthroscopy is a commonly performed procedure that carries a notable risk of nerve injury secondary to port placement and the use of axial traction. Sensory neurapraxia of the pudendal nerve and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is most common; however, sexual dysfunction and sciatic nerve injury has also been reported. Reported incidence of nerve injury ranges between 1.4% and 5% in the literature, but much of these data are based on unsolicited patient concerns. This study aimed to determine the true rate of nerve injury among this patient population through administration of a validated survey at multiple time points. METHODS: A prospective study of all patients undergoing hip arthroscopy requiring traction by a single surgeon at our institution was performed. These cases were the first 100 hip arthroscopies performed in practice by the surgeon. Before surgery, all patients were asked about the presence of neuropathic symptoms including sexual dysfunction through administration of a validated questionnaire. The same questionnaire was then administered at several time points postoperatively: on the day of surgery, on postoperative day 2, at the first follow-up visit, and if symptoms persisted, then at each follow-up appointment until resolution of the symptoms. Overall incidence of nerve injury was then calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate whether traction time, sex, body mass index (BMI), or technically demanding surgical skills affected the incidence. RESULTS: This study included a total of 100 patients with an average age of 29 (13 to 62) years and an average BMI of 25. Nerve injury was seen in 13 patients with an incidence of 13%. Specific nerves injured included the pudendal (9), lateral femoral cutaneous (2), sciatic (1), and superficial peroneal nerves (1). Subgroup analysis did not demonstrate a notable association between the risk of nerve injury and increased traction time, sex, or increased BMI. The technically demanding surgical skills was associated with a notable decrease in the traction time, but no notable difference in the risk of nerve injury was observed. Most nerve injuries resolved within 2 weeks (8 of 13), and all cases of nerve injury resolved within 9 months. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of nerve injury after hip arthroscopy may be markedly higher than previously reported; however, resolution seems to occur as previously found in the literature. Patients should be educated regarding the risk of nerve injury during this procedure.

The objective of this study was to provide and validate a Dutch version of the MSISQ-15 in patients with neurological disease such as MS and spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: The linguistic validation process of the original English MSISQ-15 into Dutch was performed according to standardized guidelines. Sexually active patients with MS or spinal cord disorders, including SCI and cauda equine syndrome, who visited a tertiary urology center or a rehabilitation center completed the MSISQ-15, Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12) in women, or International Index of Erection Function (IIEF-15) in men at baseline (test) and 2 weeks later (retest). A reference group recruited from a general medical practice completed the questionnaires once. Data were analyzed for measurement properties. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with MS, 49 patients with spinal cord disorder, and 50 references were included. Content validity was adequate. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.8) and reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.8) of the MSISQ-15 were excellent. Patients' MSISQ-15 scores were correlated with severity of symptoms of sexual dysfunction measured by PISQ-12 or IIEF-15 and confirmed positive rating for criterion validity. MSISQ-15 scores in patients were higher than in references (on a scale of 15-75: 38.9 ± 11.4 vs 21.1 ± 5.4; P < 0.001), indicating good construct validity. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch MSISQ-15 is a reliable and valid measure to evaluate symptoms of sexual dysfunction in patients with MS or with SCI.","10.1002/nau.23804","Adult; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis; Netherlands; Reproducibility of Results; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Spinal Cord Injuries; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translations","neurogenic; quality of life; surveys and questionnaires; urinary bladder; validation studies","Journal Article; Validation Study"

Part A","2018","The number of cases of erectile dysfunction (ED) caused after radical prostatectomy (RP) prostate cancer treatment is increasing steadily. Although various studies have been conducted for treatment of post-RP ED, there is still a need for more effective methods. A dual growth factor incorporated heparin-pluronic/gelatin-poly(ethylene glycol)-tyramine (HP/GPT) hydrogel, which consists of a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-loaded HP hydrogel and nerve growth factor (NGF)-loaded GPT hydrogel, can control dose and rate of growth factor release. In this study, we demonstrated that dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel could further improve erectile function in a rat model of bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI). We showed that erectile function was decreased after BCNI, but it was further improved by treatment with a dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel compared with groups treated with single growth factor in a rat model of cavernous nerve injury. Also, we observed an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in the dual growth factor group when compared with the groups treated with single growth factor. This effect was associated with greater upregulation of nitric oxide synthase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in the penile tissue of the group treated with dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT than in the other experimental groups. Apoptosis in the penile tissue treated with the dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel was lower than those treated singly with either bFGF or NGF incorporated GPT hydrogel. Both α-smooth muscle actin and CD31 expression increased in the group treated with dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel when compared to in the other experimental groups. Altogether, our results proved that the sequential and continuous release of growth factors from dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel prevented fibrosis and nerve damage induced by BCNI in the corpus cavernosum, and promoted the recovery of erectile function. Dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel may be a potent clinical application for the treatment of post-RP ED and could potentially be used various biomedical application in tissue regnerative medicine.","10.1089/ten.TEA.2017.0469","Animals; Delayed-Action Preparations; Erectile Dysfunction; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Gelatin; Heparin; Male; Nerve Growth Factor; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Poloxamer; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tyramine","NGF; bFGF; biocompatible materials; erectile dysfunction; growth factor; hydrogel","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

OBJECTIVES: To investigate women's experience of sexuality after spinal cord injury (SCI) with a focus on rehabilitation and manging practical impact. SETTING: Women with SCI living in the community in United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Participants were recruited via three UK SCI centres, ensuring tetraplegia, paraplegia and cauda equina syndrome representation. Single semi-structured interviews exploring individual's experiences around sexuality following SCI were recorded and transcribed for thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven women aged 21-72 years, sexually active since SCI were interviewed, each lasting 17-143 min (mean 55 min). Six key themes emerged: physical change, psychological impact, dependency, relationships and partners, post injury sexual life and sexuality rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Sexuality remains an important, valued aspect of female identity following SCI; sexual activity continues and though altered remains enjoyable and rewarding. Sexuality rehabilitation should commence early, preparing women for altered sexual sensation, disclosure of altered sexual function to partners, and encouraging early self-exploration. Techniques optimising continence management in preparation for and during sex should be taught. Participants identified a need for women-only education and support groups, increased peer support, self-esteem, communication and social skills training and even fashion advice and pampering sessions during rehabilitation. Support and education for partners are needed. Staff require support to be knowledgeable and confident in addressing women's sexuality needs. Use of the Ex-PLISSIT model for psychosexual support could help staff to better meet these needs.","10.1038/s41393-018-0188-6","Adult; Aged; Cauda Equina Syndrome; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Paraplegia; Quadriplegia; Qualitative Research; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners; Spinal Cord Injuries; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

After 14 days of treatment, erectile function was measured via intracorporal pressure normalized to mean arterial pressure (ICP/MAP) and the major pelvic ganglion and cavernous nerve harvested for western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of phosphorylated-IGF-1Rβ (p-IGF-1Rβ), phosphorylated-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and neuronal NOS (nNOS). BCNI  +  Pio animals exhibited improvements in ICP/MAP, similar to Sham animals, and BCNI  +  Pio  +  JB-1 rats demonstrated a reduced ICP/MAP similar to BCNI-only rats at all measured voltages. Western blot results showed upregulation of p-IGF-1Rβ was observed in the BCNI  +  Pio group. Low levels of p-ERK1/2 were seen in the JB-1-treated animals. The immunoblot results were supported by IHC findings. Intense IHC staining of nNOS was detected in the BCNI  +  Pio group. The group treated with JB-1 showed minimal protein expression of p-ERK1/2, nNOS, and p-IGF-1Rβ. Pio improves erectile function in rats undergoing BCNI via an IGF-1-mediated pathway.","10.1038/s41443-018-0054-2","Animals; Erectile Dysfunction; Male; Nerve Crush; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Penile Erection; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Phosphorylation; Pioglitazone; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptor, IGF Type 1; Signal Transduction; Up-Regulation","","Journal Article"
"30067887","Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation for Chronic Pelvic Pain: A Case Series and Technical Report on a Novel Lead Configuration.","Hunter CW; Yang A","Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society","2019","INTRODUCTION: Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is an elusive and complex neuropathic condition that is notoriously recalcitrant to treatment. The term ""CPP"" encompasses a number of treatment-resistant conditions like pudendal neuralgia, interstitial cystitis, coccygodynia, vulvodynia. CPP has been presented neuromodulators attempting to utilize conventional spinal cord stimulation (SCS), with constant frustration and high explant rates. Contrary to SCS, dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) delivers targeted target to focal areas, does not rely on paresthesias, and is able to reliably capture body parts like the pelvis making it an ideal modality for the treatment of CPP. We present seven patients with intractable CPP, resistant to conventional treatment methods, all successfully treated with DRGS. METHODS: The case series includes seven patients with severe, CPP who failed to respond to a variety interventional treatments, and in some cases SCS. All seven patients were successfully trialed with DRGS utilizing leads placed over the bilateral L1 and S2 DRG's-to our knowledge, no publications describing either this particular lead configuration, or utilizing DRG stimulation on CPP, exist. RESULTS: Following treatment, all seven patients experienced significant pain relief as well as reduction in opioid consumption and some cases improvement with sexual function and urination. Four of these patients have been implanted and continue to self-report sustained pain relief with high-satisfaction and functional improvement. To date no explants or instances of loss of efficacy have occurred (>1 year since implant). CONCLUSION: Like most neuropathic pain states, CPP is resilient, difficult to manage, and typically unresponsive to the traditional therapeutics and SCS. Our case series demonstrates no only that DRGS is potentially effective, long-term treatment modality for CPP, but that the L1/S2 lead placement is the configuration of choice despite distinct differences in etiologies of pain and location.","10.1111/ner.12801","Adult; Chronic Pain; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Electrodes, Implanted; Female; Ganglia, Spinal; Humans; Middle Aged; Neuralgia; Pain Management; Pelvic Pain","Complex Regional Pain Syndrome; DRG Stimulation; dorsal root ganglion stimulation; neurostimulation; pelvic pain; spinal cord stimulation","Case Reports; Journal Article"

OBJECTIVE: To describe the presence of sexual dysfunction and comorbidities in a population with chronic neurological disorders. To analyze the relationship between disability and sexual dysfunction. METHODS: A cross-sectional case-control study was carried out. Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke of at least one year since the onset of symptoms were included, and compared with controls with no neurological disease, matched by age and sex. RESULTS: We included 71 participants: 29 controls, with a mean age of 49.4 years, and 42 patients with a mean age of 53.8 years. Sexual dysfunction was present in 22.5% of the controls and 77.5% of the patients. A statistically significant relationship between sexual dysfunction and disability was found in the logistic regression analysis (OR = 20.38, 95%CI: 2.5 -165.86). CONCLUSIONS: Disability proved to be the main variable related to the presence of sexual dysfunction. Patients with ALS had the worst rates of sexual dysfunction. Patients with MS were similar to the control group. As for the PD group, no patient had normal sexuality. Finally, in stroke patients, the presence of comorbidities and their treatment may have negatively influenced sexuality. These findings showed that patients with chronic neurological diseases have sexual dysfunction and underscore the need for neurologists to know and address this problem.","10.1590/0004-282X20180061","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Case-Control Studies; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis; Nervous System Diseases; Parkinson Disease; Severity of Illness Index; Stroke","","Journal Article"

METHODS: Data sources were MEDLINE, Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. All types of studies describing the presence of lower urinary tract dysfunction, erectile dysfunction (ED), anejaculation, and other sexual disorders in male patients with CMT were included. RESULTS: Among 131 records identified, five articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Lower urinary tract dysfunction, neurogenic bladder, ED, and other sexual dysfunctions have been reported in patients with CMT. One case of anejaculation has been described.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Throughout this video, which was approved by the institutional board review, we demonstrate safe and complete surgical treatment of a patient suffering severe pelvic and diaphragmatic endometriosis. The patient complained of menstrual dyspnea and shoulder pain persisting despite hormonal treatment, associated with persistent dyspareunia and pelvic pain despite a previous laparoscopic surgery. Patient positioning and anesthesia were adapted to the special requirements of the surgical technique and the expected risks. The operation consisted of the exposure of the right diaphragm by mobilization of the liver, CO2 laser vaporization of left and right diaphragmatic lesions, nerve-sparing excision of infiltrating nodules, and pleural exploration. Finally, we performed an excision of pelvic endometriosis. Participation of 3 surgical teams to this procedure allowed a safe and complete laparoscopic treatment with resolution of pain symptoms at a 1- and 3-month follow-up.

There has been a shortage of an effective treatment method until now. In this study, a total of 48 adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly equally divided into four groups, including group 1-sham surgery with cavernous nerve exposure plus vehicle, group 2-bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI) plus vehicle, group 3-BCNI plus adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs)-derived exosomes (ADSC-Exo), and group 4-BCNI plus bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSCs)-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exo). Twenty-one days following surgery, erectile function was measured before tissue harvest. Histologic and Western blot analyses were then performed. Exosomes were capable of internalization into human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro and could be detected in the corpus cavernosum in vivo. The nNOS expression in the penile dorsal nerves (DN) and major pelvic ganglion (MPG), protein level of neurofilament in the DN, endothelial markers vWF, alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), the ratio of smooth muscle to collagen content were obviously lower in BCNI group compared with the sham group, while ADSC-Exo and BMSC-Exo groups resulted in significant restoration of the above histopathological changes. Moreover, BCNI treated with ADSC-Exo or BMSC-Exo had significantly higher mean intracavernous pressure/mean arterial pressure ratio compared with BCNI group. The results demonstrated that both ADSC-Exo and BMSC-Exo treatment could significantly alleviate pathological changes and improve the erectile function in BCNI-related rats. Exosomes derived from ADSCs and BMSCs may be a potential agent for pRP-ED treatment.","10.1111/andr.12519","Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Coculture Techniques; Crush Injuries; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Exosomes; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Nerve Regeneration; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Phenotype; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Recovery of Function; Time Factors","cavernous nerve injury; erectile dysfunction; exosomes; radical prostatectomy","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Our previous study showed that nanotechnology improved adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) therapy for erectile dysfunction of cavernous nerve injury (CNI) by attracting cells in the corpus cavernosum. These results indicated the possibility of using a reduced dosage of ADSCs for intracavernous injection. In this exploratory study, we used lower dosage (2 × 105 cells) of ADSCs for intracavernous injection (ICI) and the nanotechnology approach. Intracavernous pressure and mean arterial pressure were measured at day 28 to assess erectile function. The low-dose ADSC therapy group showed favorable treatment effects, and nanotechnology further improved these effects. In vivo imaging of ICI cells revealed that the fluorescein signals of NanoShuttle-bound ADSCs (NanoADSCs) were much stronger than those of ADSCs at days 0, 1, and 3. Both immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in smooth muscle, endothelium, and nerve tissue in the ADSC group compared to that in the CNI group; further improvement was achieved with assisted nanotechnology. These findings demonstrate that nanotechnology can be used to further improve the effect of small dosage of ADSCs to improve erectile function. Abundant NanoADSCs remain in the corpus cavernosum in vivo for at least 3 days. The mechanism of erectile function improvement may be related to the regeneration of the smooth muscle, endothelium, and nerve tissues.","10.4103/aja.aja_48_18","Animals; Cell Tracking; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Treatment Outcome","adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC); cavernous nerve injury; cell tracking; erectile dysfunction","Journal Article"

METHODS: A retrospective chart review including 65 female patients with Tarlov cysts was completed. Clinical findings were collected from a database of subjects seen in our institution's urogynecology and neurosurgery clinics between 2004 and 2015. A statistical analysis was performed to test for any correlation between cyst size or location, and patient symptoms or examination findings. RESULTS: Tarlov cysts were most commonly located from S2 to S3 (73%), and ranged in size from 1 to 2 cm (55%). Frequently reported symptoms included lower back pain (83%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-0.91), lower extremity radiculopathy (75%, CI 0.63-0.85), positional pain (62%, CI 0.50-0.73), urinary urgency (54%, CI 0.41-0.66) and urinary frequency (48%, CI 0.35-0.61). Common urodynamic findings included an early sensation of filling (70%), involuntary detrusor contractions (33%), urethral instability (33%) and stress urinary incontinence (33%). A statistical analysis comparing cyst size and location to clinical findings was significant for a correlation between an S2 location and central nervous system symptoms (P = 0.02), larger cyst size and urinary dysfunction (P = 0.05) and smaller cyst size and an early sensation of filling (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with symptomatic sacral Tarlov cysts frequently report pain and neuropathy related to the lower back, pelvis and urogenital system. As compared to the general population, urinary urgency and urodynamic findings associated with urgency were more frequent in our patient sample. These findings suggest that Tarlov cysts may have a clinically significant impact on urogenital function.","10.1111/jog.13711","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain; Middle Aged; Pelvic Pain; Radiculopathy; Retrospective Studies; Tarlov Cysts; Urination Disorders","neurology; pelvic pain; sexual dysfunction; urinary incontinence; urodynamics","Journal Article"

There are several clinical forms, the most frequent being Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy. AIM: To analyse how muscular dystrophies have been portrayed in literature, cinema and television. DEVELOPMENT: Muscular dystrophy is a disorder that has been reflected in literature, cinema and television. In some cases it is only mentioned, sometimes it plays a secondary role in the plot, and in others it is the lead character who suffers from the disease. In general, reference is made to Duchenne's disease and, albeit less frequently, to Becker muscular dystrophy, although in some cases the patient is just said to be suffering from muscular dystrophy, without specifying what clinical variety it belongs to. Testimonials, novels, comics, fiction films, documentaries, short films and television programmes have all been produced with the aim of making the disease and its implications more widely known, as well as making the public aware of the need to invest resources in research. CONCLUSIONS: Muscular dystrophy has been portrayed quite realistically in literature, cinema and television, and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is the clinical variety that has been shown most often. Aspects that have been reflected include its symptoms, progression, prognosis, the role of the family and caregivers, sexuality, palliative care, patients' will to overcome difficulties and the need to raise society's awareness of the condition and to invest more resources in research. TITLE: Las distrofias musculares en la literatura, el cine y la television. UNLABELLED: Introduccion.

METHOD: We searched Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed for full-text articles reporting results from studies of caregiver burden in DMD. RESULTS: We identified 483 unique publications. Of these, 450 were excluded after title and abstract screening, and 12 after full-text review. A total of 21 articles were included for data synthesis. Results encompassing more than 15 aspects of caregiver burden, investigated through surveys and/or interviews across 15 countries, were identified in the literature. Caregiving in DMD was frequently associated with impaired health-related quality of life, poor sleep quality, reduced family function, depression, pain, stress, sexual dysfunction, and/or lower self-esteem, as well as a considerable impact on work life and productivity. INTERPRETATION: Providing informal care to a patient with DMD can be associated with a substantial burden. Yet, more research is needed to better understand the clinical implications of caregiving in DMD and the relationship between caregiver burden and the progression of the disease. Our data synthesis should be helpful in informing clinical and social support programmes directed to families caring for a patient with DMD.

The disease is caused by an expansion of the CAG repetition in the androgen receptor gene. Patients with Kennedy's disease have more than 39 CAG repetitions. We report a case of 57-year-old man, resident of Monte Dourado (PA, Brazil) who complained of brachiocrural paresis evolving for 3 years along with fasciculations and tremors of extremities. In addition, he also developed dysarthria, dysphagia, and sexual dysfunction. The patient clinical picture included gait impairment, global hyporeflexia, proximal muscle atrophy of upper limbs, deviation of the uvula to right during phonation and tongue atrophy with fasciculations. The patient reported that about 30 years ago he had undergone gynecomastia surgery. His electroneuromyography suggested spinal muscular atrophy, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging showed tapering of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord. Patient's creatine kinase level was elevated. In view of the findings, an exam was requested to investigate Kennedy's disease. The exam identified 46 CAG repetitions in the androgen receptor gene, which confirmed the diagnostic suspicion. This was the first case of Kennedy's disease diagnosed and described in the Brazilian Amazon. To our knowledge only other four papers were published on this disease in Brazilian patients. A brief review is also provided on etiopathogenic, clinical and diagnostic aspects.

METHODS: We present a phase 2 clinical trial in patients with chronic SCI who received three intrathecal administrations of 100 x 106 MSCs and were followed for 10 months from the first administration. Efficacy analysis was performed on nine patients, and safety analysis was performed on 11 patients. Clinical scales, urodynamic, neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies were performed previous to treatment and at the end of the follow-up. RESULTS: The treatment was well-tolerated, without any adverse event related to MSC administration. Patients showed variable clinical improvement in sensitivity, motor power, spasms, spasticity, neuropathic pain, sexual function or sphincter dysfunction, regardless of the level or degree of injury, age or time elapsed from the SCI. In the course of follow-up three patients, initially classified as ASIA A, B and C, changed to ASIA B, C and D, respectively. In urodynamic studies, at the end of follow-up, 66.6% of the patients showed decrease in postmicturition residue and improvement in bladder compliance. At this time, neurophysiological studies showed that 55.5% of patients improved in somatosensory or motor-evoked potentials, and that 44.4% of patients improved in voluntary muscle contraction together with infralesional active muscle reinnervation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample consisted of 48 patients (33 females) and control group included 80 healthy volunteers (58 females) with no history of CTS. The following measurements were performed: the wrist circumference, length of the hand, the hand's width, width of the wrist, thickness of the wrist, height of the hypothenar and thenar, length of the arm and forearm, circumference of the proximal phalanges and width of the digits; as well as several indexes were calculated i.e.: body mass index (BMI), shape index, digit index, wrist index, hand length/height ratio (HLH-ratio) and hand length/upper limb length ratio (HLULL-ratio). RESULTS: Correlation coincidences were analysed between circumferences within the hand, palm and body weight. All parameters except fingers were correlated with body weight in either gender in both groups (p < 0.05; r = 0.40-0.80); Furthermore, width of the hand was correlated with body height (p < 0.001; r = 0.56-0.71). Mean values of wrist index for CTS patients were: males: 0.8, females: 0.74 (significantly higher than in healthy individuals and indicating square shape); shape index: males 76.5, females 75.8; digit index: males 55.7, females 56.5. The calculated HLH-ratio in CTS group was: males 10.6, females 10.9; HLULL-ratio: males 23.6, females 24.9 and they did not differ significantly from healthy volunteers. Almost 90.0% of females with diagnosed CTS have BMI > 25.0 kg/m2. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in morphometrical features of the upper limbs between CTS patients and healthy individuals. Hands of patients with CTS are more massive and with 'plumb' fingers and square shape of the wrist. Furthermore, higher BMI values were confirmed to be predisposing factors in CTS occurrence.","10.5603/FM.a2018.0049","Adult; Anthropometry; Carpal Tunnel Syndrome; Case-Control Studies; Female; Hand; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Risk Factors","anthropometry; carpal tunnel syndrome; hand measurements; risk factor; shape index; wrist","Journal Article"
"29796819","Endoscopic transperineal pudendal nerve decompression: operative pudendoscopy.","Beco J; Seidel L; Albert A","Surgical endoscopy","2018","BACKGROUND: Pudendal nerve entrapment can produce a pudendal syndrome comprising perineodynia together with urinary, sexual, and anorectal symptoms. This syndrome can be treated surgically by the transperineal approach. By using an endoscope during the procedure (""operative pudendoscopy""), the surgeon has close-up visual control of each decompression steps, demonstrates the different levels of entrapment, and cuts the sacrospinous ligament under visual control. The aim of this study was to describe the technical details of this new technique and its outcome in the treatment of the pudendal syndrome. METHODS: A series of 113 patients with severe pudendal syndrome underwent operative pudendoscopy. A complete history, pain visual analog scale (VAS) for perineodynia, and four scores evaluating the main symptoms (ICIQ-SF, NHI-CPSI, St Mark's, and Wexner) were obtained before and at least 24 months after surgery. The three clinical signs of pudendal syndrome (abnormal pinprick sensitivity, painful skin rolling test, and painful pudendal nerve) and perineal descent were analyzed before and after surgery in 91 patients. RESULTS: The mean operating time per side was 50.3 ± 15.2 min and the average hospital stay was 2.1 ± 0.4 days. Perineodynia VAS dropped from 7.2 ± 1.4 to 4.5 ± 2.9 after surgery (p < 0.0001) and the symptoms scores significantly improved. Frequency of sexual arousal syndrome, dyspareunia, and cystalgia was also significantly reduced. Pathological perineal descent (≥ 1.5 cm measured with a Perineocaliper®) observed in 13 patients was reduced from 1.81 to 0.77 cm after surgery (p < 0.0001). The only significant complication was severe hemorrhage in one patient induced by an inferior gluteal vessel laceration and successfully treated by arterial embolization. CONCLUSIONS: A complete pudendal nerve decompression, from the distal branches to the sacral foramina, safely performed under visual control by using operative pudendoscopy markedly improves clinical signs and symptoms of the pudendal syndrome.","10.1007/s00464-018-6239-4","Decompression, Surgical; Dyspareunia; Endoscopy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pudendal Nerve; Pudendal Neuralgia; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Visual Analog Scale","Descending perineum syndrome; Endoscopy; Incontinence; Perineal pain; Perineology; Pudendal nerve","Journal Article"

ZIKV can be transmitted by bites from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species, sexual activity, blood transfusion and from mother to fetus during pregnancy and delivery. A total of 50 territories and countries in the Americas had reported ZIKV infections. For those with symptoms, the presentation is similar to dengue fever with body aches, joint pain, fatigue, malaise, fever and conjunctivitis lasting up to seven days. A maculopapular rash may also occur and is usually pruritic. Neurological complications are well documented and include Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and congenital ZIKV syndrome, and less frequently acute myelitis and meningoencephalitis. ZIKV infection usually causes a mild illness and most patients are managed conservatively. Currently, no antiviral therapy is available. The most appropriate therapy for ZIKV-associated GBS is yet unclear, however intravenous immunoglobulins have been used, as in conventional GBS. ZIKV infection can be prevented through the use of mosquito repellents, protection with long-sleeved clothing and trousers, and the use of clothes impregnated with permethrin. This review describes the current concepts regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical manifestations and neurological complications of ZIKV infection.","10.1016/j.jcrc.2018.03.030","Acute Disease; Advisory Committees; Antiviral Agents; Critical Care; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Global Health; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Infectious Disease Medicine; Meningoencephalitis; Myelitis; Nervous System Diseases; Pregnancy; RNA Viruses; Societies, Medical; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Clinical features; Epidemiology; Neurological complications; Zika virus","Journal Article; Review"

DESIGN: A step-by-step explanation of the surgery using video (educative video) (Canadian Task force classification II). The university's Ethics Committee ruled that approval was not required for this video. SETTING: Kocaeli Derince Education and Research Hospital, Kocaeli, Turkey. PATIENT: A 26-year-old patient who had failed medical therapy and presented with complaints of numbness and burning pain on the right side of her vagina and pain radiating to her lower limbs for a period of approximately 36 months. INTERVENTION: The peritoneum was incised along the external iliac vessels, and these vessels were separated from the iliopsoas muscle on the right side of the pelvis. The laparoscopic decompression of intrapelvic vascular entrapment was performed at 3 sites: the lumbosacral trunk, sciatic nerve, and pudendal nerve. The aberrant dilated veins were gently dissected from nerves, and then coagulated and cut with the LigaSure sealing device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The operation was completed successfully with no complications, and the patient was discharged from the hospital 24 hours after the operation. At a 6-month follow-up, she reported complete resolution of dyspareunia and sciatica (visual analog scale score 1 of 10). CONCLUSION: A less well-known cause of chronic pelvic pain is compression of the sacral plexus by dilated or malformed branches of the internal iliac vessels. Laparoscopic management of vascular entrapment of the sacral plexus has been described by Possover et al [1,2] and Lemos et al [3]. This procedure appears to be feasible and effective, but requires significant experience and familiarity with laparoscopy techniques and pelvic nerve anatomy.","10.1016/j.jmig.2018.04.014","Adult; Chronic Pain; Decompression, Surgical; Dyspareunia; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Lumbosacral Plexus; Pelvic Pain; Pelvis; Pudendal Nerve; Pudendal Neuralgia; Sciatic Nerve; Sciatica","Laparoscopy; Nerve entrapment syndrome; Neuropelveology; Pudendal neuralgia; Sciatica","Case Reports; Journal Article; Video-Audio Media"

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the clinical predictors of future camptocormia in a cohort of PD patients. METHODS: A total of 263 PD patients without camptocormia were prospectively monitored for approximately 3 years. The end-point was the occurrence of camptocormia. RESULTS: Overall, camptocormia was observed in 23 patients (8.7%) during the study period. The following variables including the proportion of males; age; disease duration; total levodopa equivalent daily dosage; Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) III score; Hoehn and Yahr stage; the percentages of festination, freezing of gait and falls; and the subscores (e.g., ""problems having sex"") and frequencies (e.g., ""forget to do things"") of the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale were significantly higher in patients with camptocormia compared to those variables in patients without camptocormia (P < 0.05). Patients with camptocormia showed lower ""orientation"" subscore of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale than patients without camptocormia (P < 0.05). The binary logistic regression model indicated that the presence of camptocormia was associated with male sex (OR = 6.758, P = 0.001), a higher UPDRS III score (OR = 1.099, P = 0.001), a higher sexual dysfunction score (OR = 1.033, P = 0.038) and a lower orientation score (OR = 0.392, P = 0.018).

"29565955","Chronic Pelvic Pain: Neurogenic or Non-Neurogenic? Warm Detection Threshold Testing Supports a Diagnosis of Pudendal Neuropathy.","Antolak SJ; Antolak CM","Pain physician","2018","BACKGROUND: Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in men is rarely considered to have a neurogenic (neuropathic) basis. Separation of neurogenic from non-neurogenic pain is possible using clinical examination and neurophysiologic tests. A definite diagnosis of neuropathic pain can be made. OBJECTIVES: We aim to demonstrate that definite pudendal neuropathic abnormalities can be supported by a quantitative sensory test (QST) called the warm temperature threshold detection (WDT) test in men with CPP. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective review of 25 consecutive, unrecruited men evaluated in a private clinical practice beginning on January 1, 2010. The techniques of examination and neurophysiological testing have been standard since 2003. SETTING: A private practice that is a referral center because of its focus on CPP of a neuropathic basis. METHODS: Pinprick sensation was evaluated at 6 sites in the pudendal nerve territory (3 branches on each side). A WDT was performed at each nerve branch using a Physitemp NTE-2C Thermoprobe and Controller. This used a stepping algorithm from a neutral baseline of 31.5°C. Quantitative and subjective ""qualitative responses"" were recorded. Our preferred symptom score to evaluate pain level at consultation is the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). The results become the benchmark for comparison of responses following future treatments (not discussed). When possible, microscopy was used to evaluate prostate secretions for inflammatory prostatitis except in 2 men with CPP who had undergone previous radical prostatectomy for cancer. Observations were made of the skin in the pudendal territory. Our specific evaluation for neuropathy also sought evidence of multiple additional neuropathic pelvic pain generators. RESULTS: The WDT was abnormal in all men (88% quantitative), and pinprick sensation was abnormal in 92% of the men. The combination of tests provided a diagnosis of pudendal neuropathy in all patients, resulting in an accurate and timely explanation of the neurogenic basis of their CPP symptoms. The NIH-CPSI scores ranged from 10 to 35 (median 25). Four of 15 men had inflammatory prostatitis in addition to pudendal neuropathy. LIMITATIONS: There is selection bias because the men were either self-referred, suspecting their diagnosis from internet searches, or were referred by physicians who were aware of the focus of this clinical practice. The warm temperature testing used established normal values for the men. The NIH-CPSI does not evaluate sexual or bowel symptoms. Sensitivity or specificity values for the tests could not be obtained. CONCLUSIONS: A possible neuropathic basis for CPP in men can be suspected from symptoms and history of activities. A probable diagnosis of neuropathy can be determined using a pinprick sensory evaluation in the pudendal territory. A definite diagnosis of pudendal neuropathy can be made using WDT. The combination of these 2 examinations demonstrated pudendal neuropathy in 100% of this cohort.The institutional review board deemed this study met criteria for exemption.

Asexual phases occur in the musculature of different intermediate hosts. Although intestinal sarcocystosis is common in dogs, muscular symptomatic sarcocystosis is rarely reported. Here we report a fatal dual Sarcocystis spp. infection in a dog. The dog had acute onset of non-ambulatory tetraparesis. While neurological findings suggested a generalized neuromuscular disease with peripheral neuropathy concordant with the neurological deficits, the highly elevated muscle enzymes were more suggestive of a myopathy. Despite supportive therapy, the dog died three days after the onset of clinical signs. Necropsy revealed severe monophasic multifocal myodegeneration with severe pyogranulomatous inflammation. Histology revealed multiple sarcocysts in skeletal muscles and a smaller number in the heart. In light microscopy, both thin-walled and very thin-walled sarcocysts were found in skeletal muscles. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of two types of mature sarcocysts. Morphologically, cysts were indistinguishable from Sarcocystis caninum and Sarcocystis svanai, which were previously reported in a dog from USA. A region of the 18S rRNA gene sequence confirmed the presence of one species, S. arctica/caninum, without evidence for a dual infection. This is the first report of muscular sarcocystosis in a dog in Europe and, intriguingly, revealed morphologically similar species across the Atlantic.","10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.02.011","Animals; Coinfection; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Diseases; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S; Sarcocystis; Sarcocystosis","Canine; Muscular sarcocystosis; Sarcocystis spp","Case Reports; Journal Article"

Galanin has been observed to exert neuroregenerative effects in dorsal root ganglion neurons, but evidence for these effects in the major pelvic ganglion (MPG) after BCNI is lacking. AIM: To evaluate the neurotropic effects of galanin receptor agonists and antagonists in vitro in nitrergic neurons and MPG and in vivo in rats after BCNI. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent BCNI and sham surgery. Organ culture and single-cell neuron culture of the MPG were performed. Osmotic pump treatment with the galanin agonist in vivo and measurement of erectile response to electrostimulation after BCNI, immunohistochemical localization of galanin and receptors in the human neurovascular bundle, and myographic analysis of rat corpus cavernosum smooth muscle relaxation to galanin receptor agonists were investigated. OUTCOMES: Neurite outgrowth in vitro and erectile response to electrostimulation after BCNI in vivo, immunohistochemical localization of galanin and receptors, and penile muscle relaxation in vitro. RESULTS: Galanin showed neurotrophic action in vitro and inhibition of endogenous galanin significantly impaired neurite outgrowth in nitrergic but not in sympathetic MPG neurons. In vivo administration of a selective galanin receptor-2 agonist, M1145, resulted in partial recovery of erectile function (EF) after BCNI. Galanin did not act as a direct vasodilator on corpus cavernosum muscle strips. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: Endogenous neurotrophins such as galanin could be used as a strategy to improve EF for patients after BCNI from radical prostatectomy. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: We evaluated the effect of galanin on nerve regeneration and EF recovery in vivo and in vitro. Limitations include the lack of washout period for the in vivo experiment and absence of differences in the expression of neuronal markers between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: We identified galanin as a potential endogenous mechanism for nerve regeneration after BCNI, which could play a physiologic role in EF recovery after radical prostatectomy. In vivo treatment with exogenous galanin was beneficial in enhancing EF recovery after BCNI, but further research is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe step by step the technique of robot-assisted laparoscopic neurolysis of the left PN performed with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring on a 60-year-old patient diagnosed with left PNE. RESULTS: The procedure was performed satisfactorily without complications. After 24h, the patient was discharged from the hospital. We observed a 50% reduction in pain measured using the visual analogue scale 2 weeks after the procedure, which remained after 10 weeks of the neurolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted neurolysis of the PN constitutes a feasible and safe approach, enabling better visualisation and accuracy in the dissection of the PN. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is useful for locating the PN and for detecting intraoperative changes after the release of the nerve.","10.1016/j.acuro.2018.01.003","Decompression, Surgical; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pudendal Nerve; Pudendal Neuralgia; Robotic Surgical Procedures","Cirugía robótica; Nervio pudendo; Neurolysis; Neurólisis; Pudendal nerve; Robot-assisted surgery","Case Reports; Journal Article"

Sixty 11-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided equally into five groups: sham surgery (S), CNCI (I), and CNCI treated with low-dose (L), medium-dose (M), and high-dose (H) LIMK2i. The L, M, and H groups were treated with a daily intraperitoneal injection of LIMK2i (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg kg-1 body weight, respectively) for 1 week after surgery. The erectile response was assessed using electrostimulation at 1 week, postoperatively. Penile tissues were processed for Masson's trichrome staining, double immunofluorescence, and Western blot assay. Erectile responses in the H group improved compared with the I group, while the M group showed only partial improvement. A significantly decreased smooth muscle/collagen ratio and an increased content of fibroblasts positive for phospho-LIMK2 were noted in the I group. The M and H groups revealed significant improvements in histological alterations and the dysregulated LIMK2/Cofilin pathway, except for LIMK2 phosphorylation in the M group. The inhibition of LIMK2 did not affect the ROCK1 protein expression. The content of fibroblasts positive for phospho-LIMK2 in the H group returned to the level found in the S group, whereas it did not in the M group. However, the L group did not exhibit such improvements. Our data suggest that the inhibition of LIMK2, particularly with administration of 10.0 mg kg-1 body weight LIMK2i, can improve corporal fibrosis and erectile function by normalizing the LIMK2/Cofilin pathway.","10.4103/aja.aja_82_17","Animals; Cofilin 1; Electric Stimulation; Erectile Dysfunction; Fibroblasts; Fibrosis; Lim Kinases; Male; Penile Diseases; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Phosphorylation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Signal Transduction; rho-Associated Kinases","LIM kinase; erectile dysfunction; fibrosis; penis; prostatectomy","Journal Article"

TCs most frequently affect the lumbosacral plexus and therefore may cause specific symptoms such as perineal pain and neurogenic bladder, bowel, and sphincter problems. It has been estimated that 1% of the population has symptomatic Tarlov cysts (STCs). However, STCs appear to be underdiagnosed, with the pain reported by patients commonly attributed to degenerative alterations seen on MRI. The aim of the present study is to investigate the utility of a comprehensive questionnaire for use by physicians in establishing the diagnosis of STCs. METHODS: We compared questionnaire responses regarding patient history between 33 patients diagnosed with symptomatic TCs and 42 patients with chronic low back pain and sciatica due to disc problems or degenerative or inflammatory disorders. The diagnosis of STCs was confirmed using nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) of the sacral myotomes by an expert neurophysiologist. RESULTS: The questionnaire responses revealed specific differences in perineal symptoms (perineal pain, dyspareunia, coccygodynia), bowel symptoms (constipation, diarrhea), bladder symptoms (hesitation, retention, frequency), and anal sphincter problems (anal pain, mild fecal incontinence). Additionally, sitting, walking, and straining aggravated pain more frequently in STC patients, and STC patients were more often forced to stop working and/or reduce their social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Including the above-listed items in the patient history might facilitate differentiation of low back pain and sciatica due to STCs from that due to disc problems or degenerative or inflammatory disorders.","10.1007/s00701-018-3494-z","Adult; Diagnosis, Differential; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Medical History Taking; Middle Aged; Tarlov Cysts","Ischialgia; Non-specific low back pain; Perineal pain; Tarlov cysts","Journal Article"

The virus has emerged in recent years and spread throughout North and South Americas. The recent outbreak of ZIKV started in Brazil (2015) has resulted in infections surpassing a million mark. Contrary to the previous beliefs that Zika causes mildly symptomatic infections fever, headache, rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis, the recent outbreak associated ZIKV to serious neurological complications such as microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and eye infections. The recent outbreak has resulted in an astonishing number of microcephaly cases in fetus and infants. Consequently, numerous studies were conducted using in vitro cell and in vivo animal models. These studies showed clear links between ZIKV infections and neurological abnormalities. Diagnosis methods based on nucleic acid and serological detection facilitated rapid and accurate identification of ZIKV infections. New transmission modalities such as sexual and transplacental transmission were uncovered. Given the seriousness of ZIKV infections, WHO declared the development of safe and effective vaccines and new antiviral drugs as an urgent global health priority. Rapid work in this direction has led to the identification of several vaccine and antiviral drug candidates. Here, we review the remarkable progress made in understanding the molecular links between ZIKV infections and neurological irregularities, new diagnosis methods, potential targets for antiviral drugs, and the current state of vaccine development.","10.1007/s13365-018-0614-8","Aedes; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Brazil; Disease Outbreaks; Eye Infections, Viral; Fetus; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Infant; Microcephaly; Mosquito Vectors; Viral Vaccines; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Aedes mosquito; Antiviral chemotherapy; Flavivirus; Guillain-Barre syndrome; Microcephaly; Neuropathogen; Zika vaccine; Zika virus","Journal Article; Review"

METHODS: Adults who tested either positive for AHI (antibody-negative, HIV nucleic acid test [NAT] positive) or HIV NAT negative with the community-based San Diego Early Test HIV screening program were retrospectively randomized 2:1 into a derivation and validation set. In the former, symptoms significant for AHI in a multivariate logistic regression model were assigned a score value (the odds ratio [OR] rounded to the nearest integer). The score was assessed in the validation set using receiver operating characteristics and areas under the curve (AUC). An optimal cutoff score was found using the Youden index. RESULTS: Of 998 participants (including 261 non-men who have sex with men [MSM]), 113 had AHI (including 4 non-MSM). Compared to HIV-negative cases, AHI cases reported more symptoms (median, 4 vs 0; P < .01). Fever, myalgia, and weight loss were significantly associated with AHI in the multivariate model and corresponded to 11, 8, and 4 score points, respectively. The summed score yielded an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], .77-.93). A score of ≥11 was 72% sensitive and 96% specific (diagnostic OR, 70.27). CONCLUSIONS: A 3-symptom score accurately predicted AHI in a community-based screening program and may inform allocation of resources in settings that do not routinely screen for AHI.","10.1093/cid/cix1130","Acute Disease; Adult; Algorithms; California; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fever; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mass Screening; Myalgia; Public Health; ROC Curve; Random Allocation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Weight Loss","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Because of occurrence in the same geographic regions, serologic cross-reactivity, and similar but often less severe clinical manifestations, such as dengue and chikungunya infections, ZIKV infection likely has gone undetected, misdiagnosed, or both for many years. ZIKV is somewhat unique among flaviviruses in its ability to also be transmitted through sexual contact, nonsexual body fluids, and perinatally. The relatively recent detection of the link between ZIKV infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome and fetal neurological defects, including microcephaly, has prompted intense efforts aimed at the development of new and specific diagnostic tests. Infection with ZIKV has been postulated to lead to a more severe clinical course from other structurally related viruses, especially dengue, and vice versa because of a phenomenon termed antibody-dependent enhancement. Inactivated whole virus, DNA, RNA, and vectored vaccine approaches to prevent ZIKV infection are in development, as are treatments for active disease that are safe in pregnant women. Here we summarize the important epidemiologic and clinical features of ZIKV infection, as well as the progress and challenges in developing rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests and vaccines to prevent disease. We used electronic databases to identify relevant published data regarding ZIKV MeSH searches.","10.1016/j.jaci.2017.11.029","Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Microcephaly; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Guillain-Barré syndrome; Zika; chikungunya; dengue; emerging infectious diseases; flavivirus; microcephaly; vaccine","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

It may cause neurologic damage which is mainly characterized by central and mental system, while peripheral sexual damage is relatively rare in which Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) as the first performance is more rare . GBS is an autoimmune peripheral neuropathy usually triggered by an antecedent bacterial or viral infection, with SLE being a rare cause. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 65-year-old male presented to the hospital with progressive numbness and adynamia in extremities. His vital signs were stable. 5 days later, his condition aggravated and mechanical ventilation was necessitated owing to severe dyspnea. DIAGNOSES: Based on the clinical symptoms and results of the lumbar puncture and electromyography, he was first diagnosed as GBS, however, after treatment his condition was deteriorate and the blood test showed abnormal immune indices, then renal biopsy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of peripheral nervous system in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (PNS-SLE). INTERVENTIONS: Firstly he was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for 5 days. After his condition deterioration, he was conducted endotracheal intubation and, finally, a tracheostomy was performed. Later on he was treated with steroid therapy for several weeks. OUTCOMES: The patient showed remarkable recovery and was able to walk on his own by the time of discharge. LESSONS: PNS-SLE can, by itself, be one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Electromyography and renal biopsy should be considered when relevant. Peripheral neuropathy in SLE should be given greater recognition, and rarer forms of presentation should be taken seriously in the differential diagnosis when the clinical picture is atypical. Glucocorticoids may play an important role in the treatment of PNS-SLE.","10.1097/MD.0000000000009037","Aged; Diagnosis, Differential; Electromyography; Glucocorticoids; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Immunoglobulins, Intravenous; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

Surgical decompression and fenestration of the arachnoid cyst were performed, and the large dural defect was treated using a multilayer closure with collagen matrix, titanium mesh, and methylmethacrylate. At his 24-month postoperative follow-up, the patient had recovered full strength in his legs, and his sensory deficits and sexual dysfunction had resolved. His incision had healed well, and there were no signs of pseudomeningocele. He had no additional positional headaches. The defect was managed effectively with this technique. Although this technique is not a first-line strategy for dural closure in the spine, it can be considered in challenging cases when large dural defects are not amenable to traditional closure techniques.","10.3171/2017.6.SPINE17155","Arachnoid Cysts; Dura Mater; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Polyradiculopathy; Scoliosis; Spinal Fusion; Thoracic Vertebrae; Young Adult","AP = anteroposterior; MMA = methylmethacrylate; arachnoid cyst; cerebrospinal fluid; dural repair; duraplasty; durotomy; lumbar; methylmethacrylate; scoliosis; spine deformity; surgical technique","Case Reports; Journal Article"

The purpose of this review was to identify (1) the crude rate of pudendal nerve injury following hip arthroscopy and (2) the specific factors leading to pudendal nerve injury. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched from database inception to October 2016. Patient demographics, indications, surgical technique, complication rates, treatment approaches, and rehabilitation strategies were extracted. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies (n = 3405) were included, with the majority (66%) of studies being level IV evidence. The mean age was 33.9 ± 9.7 years (range 12-78) and 48.2% were males. Average follow-up was 30.2 ± 19.1 months. 62 patients were reported to have sustained pudendal nerve injury (1.8%) post-operatively, and all resolved within 6 weeks to 3 months. Of the seven studies that reported using a perineal post, 20 patients were diagnosed with pudendal nerve injury (4.3%), in contrast to two studies (189 patients) reporting only 0.5% pudendal nerve injury without the use of perineal post. Two studies commented on time of traction during surgical intervention with mean times of 98 and 68 min with complication rates of 10% and 6.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pudendal nerve injury is not uncommon following hip arthroscopy, with a reported rate found in this review of 1.8%. Potential risk factors may include the use of a perineal post and long traction times. All reported cases resolved within 3 months. Patients should be informed of complications related to pudendal nerve injury, which include sexual and urinary dysfunction.

KD is a late-onset neural-endocrinal disease that is characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. In addition, partial androgen insensitivity is an important manifestation of KD. Here, we report two Chinese KD pedigrees that reveal the clinical and genetic manifestations and fully elaborate the endocrinal characteristics of KD patients. The proband in pedigree 1 was referred to an endocrinologist for gynaecomastia and sexual dysfunction. A gene analysis of this patient revealed that there were 53 CAG repeats in the AR gene. A family survey identified an additional two KD patients in pedigree 1. The proband in pedigree 2 was diagnosed by a neurologist and did not have gynaecomastia or sexual dysfunction. A family survey identified an additional subclinical patient, and both patients exhibited partial androgen insensitivity at a hormonal level. We therefore suggest that a family survey and hormone tests should be routinely performed in KD patients and that physicians should increase their understanding of the different symptoms of KD to achieve correct diagnoses in affected patients.","10.1016/j.jocn.2017.10.037","Adult; Androgens; Asian People; Bulbo-Spinal Atrophy, X-Linked; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pedigree; Receptors, Androgen","Genes; Genetic diseases, X-linked; Genetic screening; Gynaecomastia; Muscular Disorders, Atrophic; Receptors, Androgen; Sexual dysfunction","Case Reports; Journal Article"

Sexual partners often become caregivers, diminishing sexuality within a relationship. This can result in decline of quality of life. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore the perspectives of individuals with ALS and their treating clinicians regarding the importance of sexuality in rehabilitation within a multidisciplinary ALS center. We hypothesize that individuals with ALS will express the need for sexuality-related discussions as a therapy. METHOD: Electronic 11-item questionnaires were anonymously completed by individuals with ALS (n = 21) and ALS healthcare professionals (n = 81) between August 2014 to June 2016. Descriptive statistics were performed in STATA 14. RESULTS: Majority (90%, n = 92) of respondents stated that ALS impacts the sexuality of an individual with ALS, and agreed that sexuality-related discussion is needed as a complementary therapy. Over 75% of clinicians reported they were not familiar with any strategies or interventions to help the patients. CONCLUSION: ALS indirectly affects sexuality, thus confirming the need for promoting awareness regarding sexuality-related topics among individuals with ALS and healthcare professionals. ALS multidisciplinary clinics need to improve their delivery of care to address sexual rehabilitation as a complementary therapy.","10.3233/NRE-172204","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Quality of Life; Sexuality; Surveys and Questionnaires","ALS; multidisciplinary care; neurosexuality; quality of life; sexuality; sexual education","Journal Article"

METHODS: Shoulder computed tomography (CT) scans from 56 subjects were retrospectively reviewed. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was performed using Mimics software, and corresponding bony references were used to evaluate glenoid morphology. To standardize evaluation, the coronal scapular plane was defined. Safe fixation distances and screw placements were investigated by constructing a simulated cutting plane of the baseplate during RSA. RESULTS: Mean glenoid height was 35.83 ± 2.95 mm, and width was 27.32 ± 2.78 mm, with significant sexual dimorphism (p < 0.01). According to the cutting plane morphology, the average baseplate radius was 13.84 ± 1.34 mm. The distances from the suprascapular notch and from two bony reference points at the base of the scapular spine to the cutting plane were 30.27 ± 2.77 mm, 18.39 ± 1.67 mm and 16.52 ± 1.52 mm, respectively, with a gender-related difference. Based on the clock face indication system, the danger zone caused by the suprascapular nerve projection was oriented between the two o'clock and eight o'clock positions in reference to the right shoulder. CONCLUSIONS: Glenoid size and the safe zone for screw fixation during RSA were characterized in a Chinese population. Careful consideration of baseplate fixation and avoidance of suprascapular nerve injury are important for improved clinical outcome.","10.1007/s00264-017-3646-4","Adult; Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Shoulder; Asian People; Bone Screws; Female; Glenoid Cavity; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Middle Aged; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Retrospective Studies; Shoulder Joint; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Morphological measurement; Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty; Screw placement; Suprascapular nerve; Three-dimensional reconstruction","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The elimination half-life of GHB from blood was reported to be dose dependent between 30 and 50min resulting in narrow detection windows of less than 12h after illicit administration or cases of drug facilitated sexual assault regardless of the biological matrix used. As sulfated metabolites tend to show prolonged half-lives and slower elimination kinetics compared to unmodified or glucuronidated drugs, the potential of GHB-4-sulfate in prolonging the detection of GHB administration was assessed. Its urinary concentrations were determined in n=100 samples from athletes and n=50 samples from sport students, and the resulting data were used to calculate a preliminary reference population-based threshold for urinary GHB-sulfate concentration. The threshold was then compared to concentrations found in post-administration urine samples collected from 3 volunteers who administered GHB within the setting of a clinical trial. Due to the large inter-individual variability of concentrations found in the reference population, GHB-4-sulfate itself was not suitable to prolong the detection times for GHB applications, even when specific gravity-corrected values were used. Therefore, a metabolomics-based approach was applied to the reference population samples and evaluated regarding other urinary metabolites that potentially correlate with the urinary excretion of GHB-4-sulfate and GHB-β-O-glucuronide in order to find a suitable marker to normalize urinary concentrations. The most promising candidate was found at a molecular mass of 321.0696 and was preliminarily identified as β-citryl-glutamic acid.","10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.08.023","Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Glucuronides; Half-Life; Humans; Hydroxybutyrates; Metabolomics; Sodium Oxybate; Substance Abuse Detection; Sulfates","Excretion study; GHB-4-sulfate; GHB-β-O-glucuronide; Metabolomics; γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)","Journal Article"

The anatomy of the rat allows the cavernous nerve (CN) to be identified, dissected, and injured in a controlled fashion. Therefore, bilateral CN injury (BCNI) in the rat model is routinely used to study post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction. AIM: To compare and contrast the available literature on pharmacologic intervention after BCNI in the rat. METHODS: A literature search was performed on PubMed for cavernous nerve and injury and erectile dysfunction and rat. Only articles with BCNI and pharmacologic intervention that could be grouped into categories of immune modulation, growth factor therapy, receptor kinase inhibition, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition, and anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic interventions were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To assess outcomes of pharmaceutical intervention on erectile function recovery after BCNI in the rat model. The ratio of maximum intracavernous pressure to mean arterial pressure was the main outcome measure chosen for this analysis. RESULTS: All interventions improved erectile function recovery after BCNI based on the ratio of maximum intracavernous pressure to mean arterial pressure results. Additional end-point analysis examined the corpus cavernosa and/or the major pelvic ganglion and CN. There was extreme heterogeneity within the literature, making accurate comparisons between crush injury and therapeutic interventions difficult. CONCLUSIONS: BCNI in the rat is the accepted animal model used to study nerve-sparing post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction. However, an important limitation is extreme variability. Efforts should be made to decrease this variability and increase the translational utility toward clinical trials in humans. Haney NM, Nguyen HMT, Honda M, et al.

Tadalafil and sildenafil are the two most common phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors used to treat ED. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to directly compare tadalafil with sildenafil for the treatment of ED. METHODS: We designed a strategy for searching the PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, Web of Science and Cochrane library databases; the reference lists of the retrieved studies were also investigated. A literature review was performed to identify all published randomized or non-randomized controlled trials that compared tadalafil with sildenafil for the treatment of ED and to assess the quality of the studies. Two investigators independently and blindly screened the studies for inclusion. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0. RESULTS: A total of 16 trials that compared tadalafil with sildenafil for the treatment of ED were included in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, tadalafil and sildenafil appeared to have similar efficacies and overall adverse event rates. However, compared with sildenafil, tadalafil significantly improved psychological outcomes. Furthermore, the patients and their partners preferred tadalafil over sildenafil, and no significant difference was found in the adherence and persistence rates between tadalafil and sildenafil. Additionally, the myalgia and back pain rates were higher and the flushing rate was lower with tadalafil than with sildenafil. CONCLUSION: Tadalafil shares a similar efficacy and safety with sildenafil and significantly improves patients' sexual confidence. Furthermore, patients and their partners prefer tadalafil to sildenafil. Hence, tadalafil may be a better choice for ED treatment.","10.1007/s11255-017-1644-5","Back Pain; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Erectile Dysfunction; Flushing; Humans; Male; Myalgia; Patient Preference; Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors; Self Efficacy; Sildenafil Citrate; Tadalafil","Erectile dysfunction; Meta-analysis; Sildenafil; Systematic review; Tadalafil","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Review"

Its etiology remains unclear, and a variety of treatments have been attempted with incomplete resolution. We propose that chronic pudendal neuromodulation (CPN) may be a useful treatment for PGAD symptoms. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for women older than 18 years with a diagnosis of PGAD that had staged neuromodulation with placement of a tined lead at the pudendal nerve. Demographic, operative, and postoperative data were collected. A survey was then sent to these women to assess additional demographic data, preoperative and postoperative symptoms, and patient satisfaction. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: Six women underwent CPN for PGAD. Mean age was 52 (SD, 9) years. Five (83%) of 6 were still implanted at time of survey, at a mean of 38 months after implantation; 1 device was removed for nonuse. Four of 6 completed surveys and were still using their device. Three of 4 had met their treatment goals and were satisfied with CPN; 3 of 4 felt CPN was the most useful treatment modality they had used overall. Chronic pudendal neuromodulation also improved chronic pelvic pain (4/4), bowel function (3/4), and bladder function (3/4). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pudendal neuromodulation can be an effective treatment for decreasing frequency of PGAD symptoms and providing symptom relief.","10.1097/SPV.0000000000000435","Arousal; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Female; Humans; Implantable Neurostimulators; Middle Aged; Pelvic Pain; Pilot Projects; Pudendal Neuralgia; Retrospective Studies; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological","","Journal Article"

This disease is presently named Transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis. We performed an extensive review on this disease based on searches in Medical databases and in paper references. In this review, we briefly summarize the epidemiology and the mechanisms involved on amyloid deposition; we detailed how to evaluate the mechanisms implicated on the development of the major signs and symptoms associated with reproductive dysfunction; and we discuss the mechanisms involved in secondary sexual dysfunction after psychological treatments. Treatment of the disease is directed towards relieving specific symptoms in association with liver transplant, and molecular and genetic therapeutics. Although the current clinical trials indicate symptoms relief, no data on the reproductive function was reported. Thus, preimplantation genetic diagnosis is presently the only available technique that eradicates the disease as it avoids the birth of new patients.","10.5935/1518-0557.20170025","Adult; Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial; Female; Humans; Male; Mutation; Peripheral Nerves; Prealbumin; Preimplantation Diagnosis","Transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis; genetics; in vitro fertilization; physiopathology; sexual dysfunction; therapy","Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

We sought to determine whether survivors' acceptance of treatment side effects also changes over the disease continuum. METHODS: Women with ovarian cancer completed an online survey focusing on survivors' goals and priorities. The survey was distributed through survivor networks and social media. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-four women visited the survey website and 328 (76%) completed the survey. Among participants, 141 (43%) identified themselves as having ever recurred, 119 (36%) were undergoing treatment at the time of survey completion and 86 (26%) had received four or more chemotherapy regimens. Respondents' goals of care were cure for 115 women (35%), remission for 156 (48%) and stable disease for 56 (17%). When asked what was most meaningful, 148 women (45%) reported overall survival, 135 (41%) reported quality of life and 40 (12%) reported progression-free survival. >50% of survivors were willing to tolerate the following symptoms for the goal of cure: fatigue (283, 86%), alopecia (281, 86%), diarrhea (232, 71%), constipation (227, 69%), neuropathy (218, 66%), arthralgia (210, 64%), sexual side effects (201, 61%), reflux symptoms (188, 57%), memory loss (180, 55%), nausea/vomiting (180, 55%), hospitalization for treatment side effects (179, 55%) and pain (169, 52%). The rates of tolerance for most symptoms decreased significantly as the goal of treatment changed from cure to remission to stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Women with ovarian cancer willingly accept many treatment side effects when the goal of treatment is cure, however become less accepting when the goal is remission and even less so when the goal is stable disease.

We describe the case of an isolated progressive compressive myelopathy revealing this complication and discuss the pathogenesis of such a presentation, its clinical and imaging peculiarities with a literature review. FINDINGS: We report on the case of a 48-year-old man with history of left brachial plexus injury at the age of 2 years. Since the age of 38 years, he had presented with a progressive paraplegia, bladder and erectile dysfunction, neuropathic pain and sensory level. The diagnosis was made by spinal cord and brain magnetic resonance follow-up imaging revealing hypointensity T2-weighted gradient echo linear dark rim around the entire neuraxis and cervical dural pseudomeningoceles. These MRI findings were suggestive of extensive hemosiderin deposition consolidating the diagnosis of SS of CNS. CONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our case report illustrates diagnosis difficulties in unusual or paucisymptomatic presentations of SS. A history of brachial plexus trauma with nerve root avulsion should prompt gradient-echo T2-weighted imaging to bring out such a complication.

However, its geographic distribution has significantly increased, and it has caused large outbreaks in the Yap Islands in 2007, in French Polynesia in 2013 and in Brazil in 2015. Multiple cases of Guillain-Barre´ syndrome occurred in French Polynesia and Columbia during outbreaks, and infections in pregnant women in Brazil have been associated with microcephaly and fetal loss. The viremic phase in humans is short, and diagnosis usually depends on positive immunoglobulin M titers with serum neutralization tests for confirmation. Treatment is directed at symptoms; there are no antiviral drugs available. Transmission can also occur through sexual contact with infected men and through blood transfusion. Prevention is important in women and includes limiting travel to endemic areas when possible, control of mosquito populations and condom use when appropriate.

By contrast, in observational studies, larger increases in many different AEs have been reported than in blinded trials. METHODS: In the Lipid-Lowering Arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, patients aged 40-79 years with hypertension, at least three other cardiovascular risk factors, and fasting total cholesterol concentrations of 6·5 mmol/L or lower, and who were not taking a statin or fibrate, had no history of myocardial infarction, and were not being treated for angina were randomly assigned to atorvastatin 10 mg daily or matching placebo in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled phase. In a subsequent non-randomised non-blind extension phase (initiated because of early termination of the trial because efficacy of atorvastatin was shown), all patients were offered atorvastatin 10 mg daily open label. We classified AEs using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. We blindly adjudicated all reports of four prespecified AEs of interest-muscle-related, erectile dysfunction, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairment-and analysed all remaining AEs grouped by system organ class. Rates of AEs are given as percentages per annum. RESULTS: The blinded randomised phase was done between February, 1998, and December, 2002; we included 101 80 patients in this analysis (5101 [50%] in the atorvastatin group and 5079 [50%] in the placebo group), with a median follow-up of 3·3 years (IQR 2·7-3·7). The non-blinded non-randomised phase was done between December, 2002, and June, 2005; we included 9899 patients in this analysis (6409 [65%] atorvastatin users and 3490 [35%] non-users), with a median follow-up of 2·3 years (2·2-2·4). During the blinded phase, muscle-related AEs (298 [2·03% per annum] vs 283 [2·00% per annum]; hazard ratio 1·03 [95% CI 0·88-1·21]; p=0·72) and erectile dysfunction (272 [1·86% per annum] vs 302 [2·14% per annum]; 0·88 [0·75-1·04]; p=0·13) were reported at a similar rate by participants randomly assigned to atorvastatin or placebo. The rate of reports of sleep disturbance was significantly lower among participants assigned atorvastatin than assigned placebo (149 [1·00% per annum] vs 210 [1·46% per annum]; 0·69 [0·56-0·85]; p=0·0005). Too few cases of cognitive impairment were reported for a statistically reliable analysis (31 [0·20% per annum] vs 32 [0·22% per annum]; 0·94 [0·57-1·54]; p=0·81). We observed no significant differences in the rates of all other reported AEs, with the exception of an excess of renal and urinary AEs among patients assigned atorvastatin (481 [1·87%] per annum vs 392 [1·51%] per annum; 1·23 [1·08-1·41]; p=0·002). By contrast, during the non-blinded non-randomised phase, muscle-related AEs were reported at a significantly higher rate by participants taking statins than by those who were not (161 [1·26% per annum] vs 124 [1·00% per annum]; 1·41 [1·10-1·79]; p=0·006). We noted no significant differences between statin users and non-users in the rates of other AEs, with the exception of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (992 [8·69% per annum] vs 831 [7·45% per annum]; 1·17 [1·06-1·29]; p=0·001) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (114 [0·88% per annum] vs 80 [0·64% per annum]; 1·40 [1·04-1·88]; p=0·03), which were reported more commonly by statin users than by non-users. INTERPRETATION: These analyses illustrate the so-called nocebo effect, with an excess rate of muscle-related AE reports only when patients and their doctors were aware that statin therapy was being used and not when its use was blinded. These results will help assure both physicians and patients that most AEs associated with statins are not causally related to use of the drug and should help counter the adverse effect on public health of exaggerated claims about statin-related side-effects.

METHODS: The family consisted of 3 affected siblings from nonconsanguineous healthy parents. All members underwent clinical and electrophysiologic evaluation and genetic analysis. Two patients underwent quantitative sensory testing (QST), cardiovascular reflexes, dynamic sweat test, and skin biopsy to evaluate somatic and autonomic cutaneous innervation and to get fibroblast cultures for developing iPSC-derived neurons. RESULTS: Onset occurred in the first decade, with painless and progressive mutilating distal ulcerations leading to amputation and joint deformity. Sensation to pain, touch, and vibration was reduced. Autonomic disturbances included hypohidrosis, pupillary abnormalities, and gastrointestinal and sexual dysfunction. Nerve conduction studies showed a severe axonal sensory neuropathy. QST and autonomic functional studies were abnormal. Skin biopsy revealed a lack of sensory and autonomic nerve fibers. Genetic analysis revealed 2 pathogenic mutations in the DST gene affecting exclusively the DST neuronal isoform-a2. Neurons derived from iPSC showed absence or very low levels of DST protein and short and dystrophic neuritis or no projections at all. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the previous HSAN-VI family, our description indicates that DST mutations may be associated with a nonlethal and nonsyndromic phenotype. Neuronal loss affects large and small sensory nerve fibers as well as autonomic ones. Induced-PSC findings suggest that dystonin defect might alter proper development of the peripheral nerves. Dystonin-a2 plays a major role in the HSAN-VI phenotype.","10.1212/WNL.0000000000003992","Adult; Dystonin; Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies; Heterozygote; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neurons; RNA, Messenger; Siblings","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

Mitochondria are considered as the powerhouse of the cell because they produce the majority of energy-rich phosphate bonds in the form of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) but they also participate in many other functions like steroid hormone synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ionic regulation, and cell death. Adequate cellular energy supply and survival depend on mitochondrial life cycle, a process involving mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and quality control via mitophagy. It appears that mitochondria are the place of marked sexual dimorphism involving mainly oxidative capacities, calcium handling, and resistance to oxidative stress. In turn, sex hormones regulate mitochondrial function and biogenesis. Mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are the origin of serious mitochondrial genetic diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also an important parameter for a large panel of pathologies including neuromuscular disorders, encephalopathies, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), metabolic disorders, neuropathies, renal dysfunction etc. Many of these pathologies present sex/gender specificity. Here we review the sexual dimorphism of mitochondria from different tissues and how this dimorphism takes part in the sex specificity of important pathologies mainly CVDs and neurological disorders.","10.1042/CS20160485","Adenosine Triphosphate; Apoptosis; Female; Humans; Male; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Diseases; Models, Biological; Reactive Oxygen Species; Sex Factors","ageing; cardiovascular diseases; gender; metabolic diseases; mitochondria; neurological disorders; oxidative stress; sex; sexual dimorphism","Journal Article; Review"

Despite the common belief that the restoration of functions that are affected by CES can take several years postoperatively, follow up seldom exceeds the first year after surgery. Long term outcome of especially micturition, defecation and sexual function-which are by definition affected in CES-are unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate 1) postoperative long term outcome of micturition, defecation and sexual function in CES patients 2) attitude of patients towards received hospital care with regard to (recovery of) these functions. METHODS: CES patients were selected by screening the records of all patients operated on lumbar herniated disc in our university hospital between 1995-2010. A questionnaire was sent to the selected CES patients evaluating current complaints of micturition, defecation and sexual function and attitude towards delivered care with focus on micturition, defecation and sexual function. RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 66 eligible CES patients were included (response rate 71%, inclusion rate 56%). Median time after surgery was 13.8 years (range 5.8-21.8 years). Dysfunction at follow up was highly prevalent: 38% micturition dysfunction, 43% defecation dysfunction and 54% sexual dysfunction. Younger age at presentation was associated with sexual dysfunction at follow up: for every year younger at presentation, odds ratio for sexual dysfunction at follow up was 1.11 (p = 0.035). Other associations with outcome were not identified. Two-third of the CES patients wished their neurosurgeon had given them more prognostic information about micturition, defecation and sexual function. CONCLUSION: The presented data demonstrate that dysfunction of micturition, defecation and sexual function are still highly prevalent in a large number of CES patients even years postoperatively. These alarming follow up data probably have a devastating effect on personal perceived quality of life, which should be studied in more detail. CES patients communicate a clear demand for more prognostic information. The presented figures enable clinicians to inform their CES patients more realistically about long term postoperative outcome of micturition, defecation and sexual function after surgical intervention.","10.1371/journal.pone.0175987","Adult; Aged; Coitus; Decompression, Surgical; Defecation; Female; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Middle Aged; Polyradiculopathy; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome; Urination","","Journal Article"

We here explored the psychiatric and andrological features of patients affected by post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) and verified whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels of neuroactive steroids (i.e., important regulators of nervous function) are modified. We found that eight out of sixteen PFS male patients considered suffered from a DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition, all PFS patients showed erectile dysfunction (ED); in particular, ten patients showed a severe and six a mild-moderate ED. We also reported abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials of the pudendal nerve in PFS patients with severe ED, the first objective evidence of a neuropathy involving peripheral neurogenic control of erection. Testicular volume by ultrasonography was normal in PFS patients. Data obtained on neuroactive steroid levels also indicate interesting features. Indeed, decreased levels of pregnenolone, progesterone and its metabolite (i.e., dihydroprogesterone), dihydrotestosterone and 17beta-estradiol and increased levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone and 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol were observed in CSF of PFS patients. Neuroactive steroid levels were also altered in plasma of PFS patients, however these changes did not reflect exactly what occurs in CSF. Finally, finasteride did not only affect, as expected, the levels of 5alpha-reduced metabolites of progesterone and testosterone, but also the further metabolites and precursors suggesting that this drug has broad consequence on neuroactive steroid levels of PFS patients.","10.1016/j.jsbmb.2017.04.003","5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors; Adult; Alopecia; Case-Control Studies; Major Depressive Disorder; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Drug Monitoring; Erectile Dysfunction; Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory; Finasteride; Humans; Incidence; Italy; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Pregnenolone; Progesterone; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Pudendal Nerve; Pudendal Neuralgia; Severity of Illness Index; Testosterone; Young Adult","5α-Reductase; Erectile dysfunction; Major depressive disorder; Pregnenolone; Progesterone; Testosterone","Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

This prospective study analyzed potential risk factors and investigated the impact of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring. METHOD: Included were 85 patients undergoing total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, 43 under the control of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring. Urogenital function was assessed with validated questionnaires within a 2-year follow-up period. Potential risk factors were identified by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Overall, approximately one-third of treated patients suffered from new onset of urinary dysfunction. Initially, half of the sexually active patients were affected by sexual dysfunction; after 2 years, almost three quarters were affected. In the pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring group, urinary and sexual dysfunction rates including minor and major disturbances were significantly lower (2-year follow-up 20% vs. 51% (p = 0.004) and 56% vs. 90% (p = 0.010)). Throughout the survey, non-performance of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring was found to be an independent risk factor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was identified as an independent predictor for urogenital dysfunction in the further course one and 2 years after surgery. CONCLUSION: Pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with significantly lower rates of urinary and sexual dysfunction in the short and long run, whereas neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has a negative impact only in the long run.","10.1007/s11605-017-3409-y","Aged; Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Organ Sparing Treatments; Pelvis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Rectal Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors","Autonomic nervous system; Intraoperative monitoring; Neoadjuvant therapy; Rectal cancer; Urogenital dysfunction","Journal Article"

OBJECTIVE: To assess sexual function in female patients with DM/PM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a monocentric, cross-sectional study in which 23 patients (16 DM and 7 PM), with ages between 18 and 40 years, were compared to 23 healthy women of the same age group. Characteristics on sexual function were obtained by applying the questionnaires Female Sexual Quotient (FSQ) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) validated for the Brazilian Portuguese language. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was comparable to controls (32.7±5.3 vs. 31.7±6.7 years), as well as the distribution of ethnicity and socioeconomic class. As for gynecological characteristics, patients and healthy controls did not differ with respect to age at menarche and percentages of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, premenstrual syndrome, pain at mid-cycle, mucocervical secretion, and vaginal discharge. The FSQ score, as well as all domains of the FSFI questionnaire (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm and satisfaction), were significantly decreased in patients vs. controls, with 60.9% of patients showing some degree of sexual dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to identify sexual dysfunction in patients with DM/PM. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is essential for patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, in order to provide prevention and care for their sexual life, providing a better quality of life, both for patients and their partners.","10.1016/j.rbre.2016.11.002","Adult; Brazil; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatomyositis; Female; Humans; Polymyositis; Quality of Life; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","Dermatomiosite; Dermatomyositis; Disfunção sexual; Inflammatory myopathies; Miopatias inflamatórias; Polimiosite; Polymyositis; Sexual dysfunction; Sexualidade; Sexuality","Journal Article"
"28325536","Self-Reported Neuropathic Pain Characteristics of Women With Provoked Vulvar Pain: A Preliminary Investigation.","Dargie E; Gilron I; Pukall CF","The journal of sexual medicine","2017","BACKGROUND: Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is a common chronic genital pain condition affecting approximately 12% of premenopausal women. Although parallels have been drawn between PVD and neuropathic pain (NP), no studies have examined self-reported NP characteristics in PVD. AIM: To explore pain symptoms that resemble NP reported by those with PVD and compare responses with those with an established NP condition. METHODS: Women with provoked vulvar pain (PVP; n = 65) completed online questionnaires designed to assess characteristics of NP. Responses were compared with those of women with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN; n = 30). OUTCOMES: In addition to a range of descriptive questions, participants completed the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Self-Complete Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Signs and Symptoms (S-LANSS), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), and the Pain Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS). RESULTS: PVP exhibits some neuropathic characteristics, typically evoked pain (as opposed to the more constant pain of PHN) indicative of allodynia and hyperalgesia. Specifically, women with PVP scored, on average, higher than the NP cutoff on the S-LANSS, and there were no significant differences between women with PVP and those with PHN on some NPSI subscales. However, women with PHN reported more NP symptoms on the PQAS, S-LANSS, and other NPSI subscales. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Validated NP questionnaires could be of particular use for health care professionals who need a more efficient way to assess symptoms of patients with PVP and should be included in future studies investigating the mechanisms and treatment of this pain. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: This study takes a unique approach to the examination of PVP by using multiple validated NP measures to compare pain characteristics with those of a group of participants with PHN, an established NP condition. However, it is limited by self-reported data not confirmed with clinical examination, small size of the PHN group, and the severity of the pain experienced in the PVP group. CONCLUSION: Women with PVP report some symptoms suggestive of NP characteristics, and future research should use NP measures in addition to physical examinations to further investigate the mechanisms that maintain this pain condition.

DESIGN: A step-by-step demonstration of our surgical procedure on video (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). Informed consent was obtained from the subject, and the applicable Institutional Review Board provided approval. SETTING: Although sacropexy does remain the 'gold standard' procedure for apical prolapse [1], the subjective outcome of the procedure has been reported to be not so satisfactory as its anatomic outcome [2]. New onset bowel symptoms have been observed with voiding and sexual dysfunctions [3]. Published data revealed a correlation between iatrogenic denervation during LSP and postoperative dysfunctions [4-6]. We adopted a nerve-preserving approach with the aim of reducing the iatrogenic morbidity. INTERVENTIONS: Our surgical nerve-preserving LSP technique from the promontory down to the right uterosacral ligament and the rectovaginal space proceeds in 3 steps: Step 1: Opening the peritoneum. The peritoneum is opened just medial to the right common iliac artery, approximately 20 to 30 mm above the sacral promontory, allowing a safe approach in an area far from nerves and vascular structures. Peritoneal incision is extended toward the promontory. The underlying presacral fascia containing the right hypogastric nerve (rHN) is identified and incised longitudinally. The presacral fascia and the rHN are then pushed medially to expose the longitudinal anterior vertebral ligament; the finding of the middle sacral veins represents the limit of any further medial dissection. Opening and displacement of the prevertebral fascia are not mandatory. Step 2: Opening the peritoneum of the right pelvic sidewall, respecting the integrity of the presacral fascia and of the rHN contained within it. An inverted L-shaped peritoneal incision extending from the sacral promontory up to the left uterosacral ligament is completed, with care taken to preserve the rHN identified previously. In proximity to the uterus, the dissection line crosses the upper edge of the right uterosacral ligament at its proximal third and extends medially. The rectovaginal space is opened and joined to the peritoneal tunnel with a section of the superficial layer of the right uterosacral ligament, preserving its deep nervous portion. Step 3: Dissection of the rectovaginal space, respecting the integrity of the rectal fascia. The rectovaginal space is fully dissected, and at its caudal edge the dissection is carried out laterally to the rectum upward to identify the pelvic parietal fascia covering the levator ani muscle, in the middle to the cranial edge of the perineal body. Preservation of the rectal fascia prevents possible injury to the middle rectal vessels and the rectal branches of the inferior hypogastric plexus, which runs close to the pelvic floor. The complete dissection of the rectovaginal space appears in an inverted V-shaped space covering approximately two-thirds of the posterior vaginal wall, with the apex at the convergence of the uterosacral ligaments. The procedure is completed with dissection of the vesicovaginal space through the creation of an avascular triangular-shaped space with the apex at the dorsal end of the bladder trigone and laterally limited by the superficial vascular layer of the vesicouterine ligaments. The bladder branches of the inferior hypogastric plexus run far from the surgical field in the deep portion of the vesicouterine ligaments. CONCLUSION: A nerve-sparing approach to pelvic spaces during LSP is feasible following well-defined surgical steps, which allow the surgeon to visualize all of the nerve pathways and potentially dangerous anatomic structures.","10.1016/j.jmig.2017.03.008","Female; Humans; Hypogastric Plexus; Laparoscopy; Organ Sparing Treatments; Organs at Risk; Pelvic Organ Prolapse; Peripheral Nerve Injuries","Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy; Nerve sparing; Pelvic organ prolapse; Surgical anatomy","Journal Article; Video-Audio Media"

A remarkable symptomatic orthostatic hypotension without changes in heart rate was present. We here describe the 3-year time course of the changes in spectral indices of cardiovascular autonomic control LF/HF and LFSAP, dysautonomia symptoms intensity and anti-nAChR antibodies following repetitive selective immunoadsorptions. During the follow-up, the reduction of anti-nAChR antibodies produced by immunoadsorption was associated with a diminished orthostatic hypotension, a restored capability to increase LF/HF, LFSAP and norepinephrine in upright position, a decline in the intensity of autonomic symptoms and an improvement of life quality. Spectral parameters LF/HF and LFSAP may represent noninvasive, low-cost biomarkers suitable for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy patients' clinical follow-up.","10.1097/HJH.0000000000001355","Autoantibodies; Autoimmune Diseases; Autonomic Nervous System; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Ganglia, Autonomic; Heart Rate; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Male; Middle Aged; Norepinephrine; Receptors, Nicotinic; Treatment Outcome","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

AIMS: To document diagnoses and treatment outcomes in a cohort of chronic vulval pain presentations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case review of the patient database of a private vulval clinic between January 2011 and March 2015. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty-five out of 3360 patients (15.6%) met the criterion of vulval pain alone. Mean age was 47.1 years (range 17-86). Average duration of symptoms was 60 months (range 3-432). Overall, 277/525 (52.7%) patients had satisfactory responses to appropriate treatment and 90/525 (17%) had partial improvement. A dermatosis was identified in 322/525 (61.3%) patients and of these, 211/322 (65.5%) had satisfactory responses to appropriate dermatological treatment. In the remaining 203/525 (38.7%) the skin was normal. These patients were questioned around the possibility of a neuromuscular cause for their pain, including pre-existing dysfunction, trauma or previous operations involving the spine, hips or lower limbs. There were 181/203 (89%) patients considered to have a neuromuscular cause for their pain and considered suitable for physiotherapy and/or neuromodulating medications. Of these patients, 63/182 (34.6%) had satisfactory responses to this treatment. One hundred and sixty-six out of 525 (31.6%) described vulval pain only during sexual intercourse. There was no statistically significant difference between different diagnoses and responses to treatment between patients reporting dyspareunia only and those sexually active women who did not experience dysparenunia (29/525, 5.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of this cohort with chronic vulval pain had a dermatological disease with a smaller proportion caused by neuromuscular dysfunction.

Current treatments of ED are mainly symptomatic. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely investigated as a potential curative treatment. Although MSC therapy consistently improved erectile functions in the pre-clinical studies the initial expectations seem to be unmet. The aim of this study is to critically review the existing studies on use of stem cells in post-prostatectomy ED and understand factors that preclude clinical translation of the available evidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search for all pre-clinical and clinical studies investigating MSCs in the treatment of post-prostatectomy ED published between January 2009 and March 2016 was performed using the PubMed database. RESULTS: A total of 24 pre-clinical studies investigated MSC based treatments in cavernous nerve injury (CNI) rodent models. In the majority of these studies intracavernous injection of MSCs at the time injury improved erectile functions. There is less data on the efficacy of MSCs when applied in a chronic disease state. Allogeneic or xenogeneic MSCs were similarly effective with limited data on immunologic response. There is a lack of conclusive data on in vivo fate of MSCs and the best route of MSC administration. CONCLUSION: MSC therapy consistently improved erectile functions after CNI. There seems to be a consensus on the disease model used and outcome evaluation however further studies focusing on immunologic response to MSCs, their mechanism of action and in vivo fate are needed before their widespread use in clinic.",NA,"Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Paracrine Communication; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Postoperative Complications; Prostatectomy; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article; Review"

Methods Sixteen consecutive female patients with pain in the labia, vestibule, and perineum, who had positive diagnostic pudendal nerve blocks from 2012 through 2015, are included. The PBPN were resected and implanted into the obturator internus muscle through a paralabial incision. The mean age at surgery was 49.5 years (standard deviation [SD] = 11.6 years) and the mean body mass index was 25.7 (SD = 5.8). Out of the 16 patients, mechanisms of injury were episiotomy in 5 (31%), athletic injury in 4 (25%), vulvar vestibulectomy in 5 (31%), and falls in 2 (13%). Of these 16 patients, 4 (25%) experienced urethral symptoms. Outcome measures included Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Vulvar Pain Functional Questionnaire (VQ), and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Results Fourteen patients reported their condition pre- and postoperatively. Mean postoperative follow-up was 15 months. The overall FSFI, and arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain domains significantly improved (p < 0.05). The VQ also significantly improved (p < 0.001) in 13 (93%) of 14 patients. The NPRS score decreased on average from 8 to 3 (p < 0.0001). All four patients with urethral symptoms were relieved of these symptoms.

Previously, we found that Li-ESWT increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here we assessed the underlying signaling pathways in Schwann cells in vitro and in penis tissue in vivo after nerve injury. The result indicated that BDNF were significantly increased by the Li-ESWT after nerve injury, as well as the expression of BDNF in Schwann cells (SCs, RT4-D6P2T) in vitro. Li-ESWT activated the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) pathway by increasing the phosphorylation levels of PERK and eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2α), and enhanced activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in an energy-dependent manner. In addition, GSK2656157-an inhibitor of PERK-effectively inhibited the effect of Li-ESWT on the phosphorylation of PERK, eIF2α, and the expression of ATF4. Furthermore, silencing ATF4 dramatically attenuated the effect of Li-ESWT on the expression of BDNF, but had no effect on hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1α or glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in Schwann cells. In conclusion, our findings shed new light on the underlying mechanisms by which Li-ESWT may stimulate the expression of BDNF through activation of PERK/ATF4 signaling pathway.

Previous research has established some of the psychosocial difficulties experienced by these patients, but direct comparisons with other pain conditions are needed. The purpose of this study was to compare women with PVD to those with postherpetic neuralgia and pain-free control participants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were invited to complete an anonymous online survey consisting of sociodemographic questions and a range of validated measures. RESULTS: Women with PVD and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) did not differ in terms of pain catastrophizing or pain anxiety, but women with PHN reported greater pain disability than those with PVD. Participants in both pain groups reported significantly more symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances than pain-free controls; women with PHN reported more symptoms of depression than those with PVD, with no other differences between pain groups. Groups did not differ on relationship adjustment, but participants with PVD reported poorer sexual functioning than the other groups. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that women with PVD and PHN experience similar mental health difficulties, but women with PHN experience more severe impact on their day-to-day functioning and mood. These results support the classification of PVD as a chronic pain condition, as both the pain groups differed from pain-free control participants on a range of measures. Finally, the presence of mental health difficulties and poorer sexual functioning highlights the importance of conducting biopsychosocial pain assessments.","10.1097/AJP.0000000000000480","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; Catastrophization; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Neuralgia, Postherpetic; Sexual Behavior; Sleep; Vulvodynia","","Comparative Study; Journal Article"

METHODS: Medical files of patients operated on lumbar herniated disc were screened for CES and retrospectively analyzed for baseline characteristics, outcome of micturition, defecation, and sexual function and possible predictors. RESULTS: Seventy-five CES patients (52% men) were included with a mean age of 44 years. L5-S1 was the most common affected level. Duration of CES complaints at presentation was, on average, 84 h (median 48 h). Prevalence of symptoms at presentation: sciatica (97%), altered sensation of the saddle area (93%), micturition dysfunction (92%), and defecation dysfunction (74%). Only 26 patients were asked about sexual dysfunction of whom 25 patients experienced dysfunction.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide valuable information regarding late and long-term effects (LLTEs). METHODS: A convenience sample from 1129 colon, rectal, and anal cancer survivors (n = 792; 218, and 119, respectively) who participated in an Internet-based survivorship care plan (SCP) tool between May 2010 and October 2014 was used to examine patient-reported demographics, treatment, and toxicity data. Responses from a follow-up survey were reviewed. RESULTS: The median age of diagnosis was 51 years, and 81% of survivors were Caucasian. The most commonly reported LLTEs for all survivors were neuropathy, fatigue, cognitive changes, changes in GI function, urogenital and sexual dysfunction, and dermatologic effects. The prevalence of these effects varied with time since diagnosis, treatment modality, and treatment center. Individuals who had survived anal cancer reported a high prevalence of sexual dysfunction and radiation-induced dermatologic effects. Over 87% of users reported satisfaction levels of good to excellent using the SCP tool, and 69% reported that they intend to share the SCP with their health care team. CONCLUSIONS: For lower GI cancer survivors, it is feasible to obtain PROs from an Internet-based survivorship tool. Survivors report a wide spectrum of LLTEs, and these can be used to inform counseling at the time of diagnosis and to help anticipate and respond to disease-related and treatment-related sequelae during follow-up.

The aim of this study was to survey the patients' perspectives and potential drawbacks following long-term use of opioids. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional survey using the Taiwanese version of Brief Pain Inventory was conducted among outpatients with chronic noncancer pain registered by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. Patients were also asked about their sexual behavior, depression, opioid misuse behaviors, and use of complementary and alternative medicine. RESULTS: For 210 of 328 outpatients (64.0%), the median pain duration was 96 months and opioid treatment duration was 57 months. The median morphine equivalent dose was 150 mg/d, with 30.5% of patients exceeding the daily watchful dose, defined as 200 mg of morphine equivalent dose. Pain reduction after taking opioids was ∼50% in the past week. The top three diagnoses were chronic pancreatitis, spinal cord injury, and neuralgia. The leading side effects were constipation (46.7%), and decreased sexual desire (69.5%) and satisfaction (57.9%). Depression was currently diagnosed in 55.2% of patients. Twenty patients (9.5%) displayed at least one aberrant behavior in the past month. Only 76 (36.2%) patients had ever received nerve block procedures, and 118 (56.2%) tried complementary and alternative medicine. CONCLUSION: This nationwide survey described the concurrent pain intensity, daily function, and various adverse effects by long-term opioids among 210 monitored outpatients with chronic noncancer pain in Taiwan. More efforts are suggested to reduce opioid prescriptions in the 30% of patients exceeding daily watchful dose.","10.1016/j.jfma.2016.10.015","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analgesics, Opioid; Chronic Pain; Constipation; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Drug Monitoring; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Morphine; Neuralgia; Pain Measurement; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Prescription Drug Misuse; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Registries; Sexuality; Spinal Cord Injuries; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult","chronic pain; noncancer; opioid","Journal Article; Observational Study"
"28012765","Impotence Following Radical Prostatectomy: Insight into Etiology and Prevention.","Walsh PC; Donker PJ","The Journal of urology","2017","This study was undertaken to identify the cause of impotence in men undergoing radical prostatectomy, with the hope that this information may provide insight into the possible prevention of this complication. The autonomic innervation of the corpora cavernosa in the male fetus and newborn was traced to determine the topographical relationship between the pelvic nerve plexus, and the prostate, urethra and urogenital diaphragm. We have demonstrated that the branches of the pelvic plexus that innervate the corpora cavernosa are situated between the rectum and urethra, and penetrate the urogenital diaphragm near or in the muscular wall of the urethra. Injuries to the pelvic plexus can occur in 2 ways: 1) during division of the lateral pedicle and 2) at the time of apical dissection with transection of the urethra. Thirty-one men who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy were evaluated to determine risk factors that correlated with postoperative impotence: 5 (16 per cent) were fully potent, 7 (23 per cent) had partial erections that were inadequate for sexual intercourse and 19 (61 per cent) had total erectile impotence. The 2 factors that had a favorable influence on postoperative potency were age and pathologic stage of the lesion: 31 per cent of the patients less than 60 years old were potent versus only 6 per cent of the patients more than 60 years, while 33 per cent of the patients with tumor microscopically confined to the prostatic capsule were potent versus only 5 per cent of those with capsular penetration. When the factors of age and capsular penetration were combined 60 per cent of the men less than 60 years old who had an intact prostatic capsule were potent. Arterial insufficiency and psychogenic factors were excluded as major contributing factors by the finding of normal penile blood flow and absence of nocturnal penile tumescence in the impotent patients. We conclude that impotence after radical prostatectomy results from injury to the pelvic nerve plexus that provides autonomic innervation to the corpora cavernosa. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether refinements in surgical technique, especially during ligation of the lateral pedicle and apical dissection, can prevent this complication.","10.1016/j.juro.2016.10.105","Aged; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Hypogastric Plexus; Male; Middle Aged; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Factors","","Journal Article"

Until 2007, only 14 human cases were reported. The first large human outbreak occurred in 2007 (Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia, Pacific) followed by French Polynesia in 2013 and Brazil in 2015. The virus is mainly transmitted through Aedes mosquito bites, but sexual and post-transfusion transmissions have been reported. Symptoms include low-grade fever, maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, myalgia, arthralgia, and asthenia. During the recent outbreaks in French Polynesia and Brazil, ZIKV infection has been associated with two major complications: microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Since fetal infection includes other birth defects, congenital Zika syndrome has been used to define in utero infection. The majority of sexual transmission occurred from a symptomatic male to a female, but female-to-male and male-to-male transmission have been reported. Asymptomatic male-to-female transmission has also been described. Importantly, ZIKV RNA can persist at least 6 months in semen. The male urogenital tract may therefore act as a reservoir for the virus. ZIKV RNA was detected in a cervical swab of a patient 3 days after presenting the classic symptoms suggesting a potential tropism for the female genital tract. Long-lasting presence of ZIKV RNA might not indicate that the individual is infectious but makes recommendation for couples potentially exposed to the virus and willing to conceive difficult. It will also be important to determine whether genital ZIKV infection might have a deleterious effect on male and female fertility.","10.1111/aji.12614","Aedes; Animals; Brazil; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Infertility, Female; Microcephaly; Polynesia; Reproduction; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","Zika; congenital infection; microcephaly; semen; sexual transmission","Journal Article; Review"

Within the past 15 years, an essential progress in recognition and understanding of the anatomy of the pelvic autonomous nervous system has been made. Surgical preservation of vegetative nerves has become well known in many cancer centers. The technique has led to improvement of the quality of life following oncologic radical procedures. Positive results have led to the adoption of such techniques in the surgical treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis in an aim to prevent urinary, rectal, and sexual dysfunction. Even though nerve-sparing excision of endometriosis is feasible and offers good outcomes in terms of bladder morbidity; digestive and sexual functions seem to be more complex to assess. Moreover, functional impairment in deep infiltrating endometriosis may preexist prior to surgery and function may not be restored despite nerve preservation. In cases where endometriosis lesions are deeply embedded in the parametrium, nerve-sparing techniques may only be feasible in those with a unilateral involvement. The nerve-sparing surgical approach is therefore a safer radical surgery in the hands of experienced surgeons that has to be tailored to the unique nature of deep infiltrating endometriosis and balanced between the natural aggressiveness of such a debilitating disease and postoperative morbidity. Good knowledge of pelvic nerve anatomy and function allows understanding of related symptoms to reduce morbidity, whenever this goal is still achievable.","10.1055/s-0036-1597305","Adult; Anatomic Landmarks; Disease Progression; Endometriosis; Female; Gynecologic Surgical Procedures; Humans; Hypogastric Plexus; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pelvis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article; Review"

But because of the high prevalence of perineal pain observed in women after childbirth, many women and caregivers fear to start pelvic floor muscle training immediately after childbirth. However, it is unknown whether pelvic floor muscle contractions (PFMC) provoke perineal pain in women shortly after childbirth. Therefore, the main objective is to study whether PFMC performed immediately after childbirth is painful or not. STUDY DESIGN: Observational longitudinal study. Perineal pain was assessed (1-6 days and 9 weeks postpartum) using a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10) during PFMC and during several activities of daily living (ADL), during micturition and defecation. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon and McNemar tests were used. RESULTS: A total of 233 women participated (148 primiparous and 85 multiparous). Immediately postpartum the prevalence and intensity of pain during ADL (73%; VAS 4.9 (±2.3)), micturition (47%; VAS 3.4 (±1.7)) and defecation (19%; VAS 3.6 (±2.2)) were significantly higher (all p<0.000) than during PFMC (8%; VAS 2.2 (±0.9)). At 9 weeks postpartum, 30% experienced perineal pain during sexual intercourse (VAS 4.6 +/- 2.3) and 18% during defecation (VAS 4.7 +/- 2.3), but none during PFMC. CONCLUSION: Perineal pain is highly prevalent immediately after childbirth during ADL, micturition and defecation, but not during PFMC (only 8%). In case perineal pain occurs during PFMC, the intensity of pain is low (VAS 2). These results show that fear of perineal pain should not discourage women to start pelvic floor muscle training shortly after childbirth.","10.1016/j.ejogrb.2016.11.009","Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Belgium; Defecation; Dyspareunia; Dysuria; Exercise Therapy; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Muscle Contraction; Neuralgia; Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Hospital; Pain Measurement; Pelvic Floor; Pelvic Floor Disorders; Perineum; Postnatal Care; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Young Adult","Pelvic floor muscle contraction; Pelvic floor muscle training; Perineal pain; Postpartum","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Observational Study"

AIM: To evaluate the modulation of the α-adrenergic system as a strategy to relieve erectile dysfunction (ED) and functional cavernosal alterations induced by CNI. METHODS: A non-selective α-blocker (phentolamine 1 mg/kg daily), a selective α1A-blocker (silodosin [SILOD] 0.1 mg/kg daily), or vehicle was orally administered for 4 weeks after bilateral crush CNI (BCNI). Erectile and neurogenic responses of the corpus cavernosum (CC) were evaluated. The acute effects of SILOD also were evaluated in vivo (0.03 mg/kg intravenously) and ex vivo (10 nmol/L). The effects of SILOD and tadalafil (TAD) on nitrergic relaxations were determined in human CC from patients with ED with a vascular etiology or ED secondary to RP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erectile responses in vivo in rats and neurogenic contractions and relaxations of rat and human CC. RESULTS: Long-term treatment with SILOD significantly improved erectile responses and allowed for the potentiation of erectile responses by acute treatment with TAD (0.3 mg/kg intravenously) in rats with BCNI. SILOD partly recovered nitrergic relaxations and normalized neurogenic contractions in CC from rats with BCNI. Long-term treatment with SILOD partly prevented BCNI-induced decreases in neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression. Acute administration of SILOD (0.03 mg/kg intravenously) improved erectile responses in vivo and potentiated nitrergic relaxation and decreased neurogenic contractions ex vivo in CC from rats with BCNI. In human CC from patients with ED with a vascular etiology, TAD (30 nmol/L), SILOD (10 nmol/L), or their combination increased nitrergic relaxations. Potentiation by TAD was lost in human CC from patients with ED after RP but was recovered after co-treatment with SILOD. CONCLUSION: α-Adrenergic modulation, especially selective α1A-blockade, improves erectile and cavernosal functions after BCNI. Modulation of the adrenergic system, mainly in combination strategies, could have a role in the management of ED after RP.","10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.10.005","Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Animals; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Crush; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prostatectomy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1; Tadalafil; Trauma, Nervous System","Cavernous Nerve Injury; Erectile Dysfunction; Neurogenic Relaxation; Prostatectomy; Rat and Human Corpus Cavernosum; Silodosin; Tadalafil; Type 5 Phosphodiesterase; α-Adrenergic Receptor","Journal Article"

Simple accurate diagnostic instruments are required for clinical research and daily practice in both high- and low-resource setting. A 4-item clinical tool (CHANT: Clinical HIV-associated Neuropathy Tool) assessing symptoms (pain and numbness) and signs (ankle reflexes and vibration sense) was developed by selecting and combining the most accurate measurands from a deep phenotyping study of HIV positive people (Pain In Neuropathy Study-HIV-PINS). CHANT was alpha-tested in silico against the HIV-PINS dataset and then clinically validated and field-tested in HIV-positive cohorts in London, UK and Johannesburg, South Africa. The Utah Early Neuropathy Score (UENS) was used as the reference standard in both settings. In a second step, neuropathic pain in the presence of HIV-SN was assessed using the Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions (DN4)-interview and a body map. CHANT achieved high accuracy on alpha-testing with sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 90%, respectively. In 30 patients in London, CHANT diagnosed 43.3% (13/30) HIV-SN (66.7% with neuropathic pain); sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 85%, and likelihood ratio = 6.7 versus UENS, internal consistency = 0.88 (Cronbach alpha), average item-total correlation = 0.73 (Spearman's Rho), and inter-tester concordance > 0.93 (Spearman's Rho). In 50 patients in Johannesburg, CHANT diagnosed 66% (33/50) HIV-SN (78.8% neuropathic pain); sensitivity = 74.4%, specificity = 85.7%, and likelihood ratio = 5.29 versus UENS. A positive CHANT score markedly increased of pre- to post-test clinical certainty of HIV-SN from 43% to 83% in London, and from 66% to 92% in Johannesburg. In conclusion, a combination of four easily and quickly assessed clinical items can be used to accurately diagnose HIV-SN. DN4-interview used in the context of bilateral feet pain can be used to identify those with neuropathic pain.","10.1371/journal.pone.0164994","Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; HIV Infections; Health Resources; Humans; Male; Neuralgia; Pain Measurement","","Journal Article; Validation Study"

Yi xue ban = Journal of Peking University. Health sciences","2016","Here we reported two patients who presented with panuveitis and were transferred from ophthalmologists to rheumatologists, for both the patients had oral and genital ulcers. They were misdiagnosed with Behcet's disease at first glance. Two young males presented with acute uveitis with history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers. They initially presented with symptoms and signs resembling Behcet's disease and were treated with systemic steroids with suboptimal responses. Routine laboratory test revealed syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. After treatment of penicillin and anti HIV virus therapy, the panuveitis was relived. The other patient was lost in the follow up. Recently epidemiological data indicate that syphilis and HIV infection increase, which can mimic the manifestation of Behcet's disease. Diagnosis of sexual transmitted diseases, such as HIV or syphilis needs to be ruled out in all cases that mimic the clinical feature of Behcet's disease, especially for those who had a history of high risk behaviors. Every patient should have history analysis in detail. Screening of sexual transmitted diseases, such as HIV or syphilis is important especially in those rapid progressive panuveitis. Also, other virus infections, such as cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus or Herpes simplex virus can cause mucosa ulcers and uveitis. CD4 T cell count is a very important marker to indicate that the patient has immunodeficiency. Erythema nodosa and pseudofolliculitis are the third common clinical manifestation in Chinese Behcet's disease patients. Rheumatologist should watch out for patients without skin involvement when making the diagnosis of Behcet's disease. Syphilis-associated uveitis usually has a good prognosis. Treatment of antibiotics can get good response, 92% uveitis can be relieved, with 67% improved vision. Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis (ASPPC) is a clinically and angiographically distinct manifestation of ocular syphilis. Systemic glucocorticoid can be used in syphilis induced posterior uveitis, sleritis and optic neuritis, and it can also prevent the Hector's reaction. However, for patients diagnosed with both HIV and syphilis, regular antibiotic can not prevent relapse. So doctors need to follow up them regularly. Patients who present with uveitis, oral and genital ulcers can be easily diagnosed with Behcet's disease. Rheumatologists need to be aware of the reemergence of sexual transmitted disease. High degree of clinical suspicion can allow ophthalmologists and rheumatologists to diagnose and treat the disease early. Correct diagnoses timely can get the good treatment response, and rescue the vision. Treatment with regular antivirus and Penicillin can receive the good response, and moreover glucocorticoid can relieve the inflammation.",NA,"Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Behcet Syndrome; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Diagnosis, Differential; Diagnostic Errors; Disease Management; Eye Infections, Bacterial; Genitalia, Male; Glucocorticoids; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Neuritis; Oral Ulcer; Panuveitis; Penicillins; Prognosis; Scleritis; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Steroids; Syphilis; Ulcer; Uveitis; Virus Diseases","","Case Reports; Journal Article; Review"

The risk of microcephaly from Zika virus infection is estimated to be highest in women who are infected during the first trimester of pregnancy. The Zika virus has been shown to have significant neurotrophism in vivo and in vitro, although further study is needed to characterize its mechanisms of pathogenesis.

We aimed to precise the neuroanatomy of the female pelvis in order to provide key-points of surgical anatomy to improve NSRH for cervical cancer. The SHP could be injured during periaortic lymph node dissection and its preservation necessitates an approach on the right side of the aorta and a blunt dissection of the promontory before lomboaortic lymphadenectomy. Injuries to HN can occur during the resection of USL at the posterior pelvic wall and of rectovaginal ligaments and to preserve HN only the medial fibrous part of the uterosacral ligament should be resected. The middle rectal artery, the deep uterine vein and the ureter should be identified to preserve PSN and IHP during resection of paracervix.

RECENT FINDINGS: Association between ZIKV infection and severe foetal outcomes, including microcephaly and other birth defects; increased rate of GBS and other neurological complications due to the ongoing ZIKV outbreak; increased evidence to date of ZIKV being the only arbovirus linked to sexual transmission; the challenge of ZIKV diagnosis; and the need for a specific point-of care test in epidemic scenarios. SUMMARY: The findings illustrate the emergence of a viral disease with the identification of new associated disorders, new modes of transmission, including maternal-foetal and sexual transmission.","10.1097/QCO.0000000000000301","Americas; Brazil; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Microcephaly; Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","Journal Article; Review"

Meta-analysis data showed that similar efficacy is achieved with medical ovarian suppression and non-pharmacological ovarian suppression (NPOS) - oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation. The acceptance rate of NPOS remains low. AIMS: This study explored the reported toxicities of PMBC women and their preferred ovarian suppression method whilst on goserelin. METHODS: A postal survey consisting of 22 study-specific questions was sent to PMBC women who received goserelin at the Flinders Medical Centre. RESULTS: Nineteen women were identified from the database; 12 versus 7 women received goserelin in the adjuvant versus metastatic setting respectively. Thirteen (68.4%) responded to the survey. Women in the adjuvant cohort were more likely to report toxicities. The most common were hot flushes (100% vs 50% P = 0.033), myalgia/arthralgia (71.4% vs 16.7%, P = 0.048) and decreased libido (57/1% vs 16.7%, P = 0.135). NPOS was recalled to be offered to five (38.5%) women, with acceptance by one BRCA2 carrier. NPOS was declined initially due to fear of procedure, surgical/anaesthetic risk, invasiveness and planned future pregnancies. If given the option, upfront oophorectomy was indicated in seven (53.8%) women due to inconveniences with monthly goserelin. CONCLUSION: Half of PMBC women indicated a preference to NPOS, but only a minority recollected NPOS being discussed. Inconvenience with monthly goserelin is the main driver toward a preference of favouring NPOS. Clarification from larger trials that research patients' decision process and preferences regarding ovarian suppression is needed to validate our findings.","10.1111/imj.13169","Adult; Aftercare; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Australia; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Goserelin; Hot Flashes; Humans; Middle Aged; Myalgia; Ovary; Premenopause; Retrospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survival Rate; Tamoxifen","breast cancer; goserelin; ovarian suppression; pre-menopausal women; preference","Journal Article"

The observations from functional imaging studies suggest that this bidirectional relationship is due in part to shared neural mechanisms. In addition to depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders, individuals with chronic pain are at risk of other mental health problems including suicide and cigarette smoking and many have sustained sexual violence. Within the broader biopsychosocial model of pain, the fear-avoidance model explains how behavioral factors affect the temporal course of chronic pain and provides the framework for an array of efficacious behavioral interventions including cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapies, and multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation. Concomitant pain and mental health disorders often complicate pharmacological management, but several drug classes, including serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants, have efficacy for both conditions and should be considered first-line treatment agents.","10.1016/j.mayocp.2016.04.029","Analgesics, Opioid; Behavior Therapy; Chronic Pain; Comorbidity; Humans; Mental Disorders; Neuralgia; Opioid-Related Disorders; Prevalence; Psychotropic Drugs","","Journal Article; Review"

Hypogonadism is the most common endocrine abnormality in POEMS syndrome. There is no data about improvement of hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction after appropriate treatment of POEMS syndrome so far. In this single-center prospective study, the efficacy of low-dose lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination therapy in the improvement of sexual and gonadal function in POEMS syndrome was evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with newly diagnosed POEMS syndrome were treated with Lenalidomide (10 mg daily for 21 days) and dexamethasone (40 mg once per week) for 12 cycles. The international index of erectile function (IIEF) in male patients, the female sexual function index (FSFI) in female patients, total testosterone, estradiol and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were reviewed. Sexual dysfunction was reported in 88.8 % (24/27)male and 90.9 % (10/11) female patients. 62.9 % (17/27) male and 25.0 % (3/12) female patients had hypogonadism. After 12-month treatment, the mean total FSFI score had increased from 17.1 ± 7.2 to 23.7 ± 7.2(p < 0.05). The arousal, orgasm and sex pain domains had been improved significantly. The mean IIEF scores had increased from 12.9 ± 13.0 to 20.5 ± 18.4 (p < 0.05). Erectile function, sexual desire and intercourse satisfaction had improved significantly at the end of treatment. No association between VEGF levels and sexual function improvement was found in both genders. CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with low-dose lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is successful in improving sexual function in POEMS syndrome.","10.1186/s13023-016-0461-8","Adult; Aged; Dexamethasone; Female; Humans; Hypogonadism; Immunologic Factors; Lenalidomide; Male; Middle Aged; POEMS Syndrome; Prospective Studies; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Thalidomide; Young Adult","Hypogonadism; Lenalidomide; POEMS syndrome; Sexual function","Journal Article"

In this report, we describe the case of a 35-year-old woman with a complex pelvic neuropathy resulting in urinary, sexual and gastro-intestinal dysfunction. She presented with an established diagnosis of interstitial cystitis; however, she also fulfilled diagnostic criteria for pudendal neuralgia and persistent genital arousal disorder. The patient underwent implantation of a combined sacral and pudendal nerve neuoromodulation device at the time of surgical decompression of the pudendal nerves.

"27228517","Measuring the Quality of Pudendal Nerve Perineural Injections.","Antolak S; Antolak C; Lendway L","Pain physician","2016","BACKGROUND: Pudendal neuropathy is a tunnel syndrome characterized by pelvic pain and may include bowel, bladder, or sexual dysfunction or a combination of these. One treatment method, pudendal nerve perineural injections (PNPIs), uses infiltration of bupivacaine and corticosteroid around the nerve to provide symptom relief. Bupivacaine also anesthetizes the skin in the receptive field of the nerve that is injected. Bupivacaine offers rapid pain relief for several hours while corticosteroid provides delayed pain control often lasting 3 to 5 weeks. Not all pudendal nerve blocks may provide complete pain relief but long-term pain control from the steroid appears to be associated with immediate response to bupivacaine. We offer a method of evaluating the quality of a pudendal block on the day it is performed using pinprick sensation evaluation. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that pinprick sensory changes provide a simple and rapid method of measuring response to local anesthetic and pain reduction provided by a PNPI on the day it is performed. This response defines the quality of each PNPI. STUDY DESIGN: This is a case series based on retrospective review of a private practice database that is maintained by HealthEast hospitals in Minnesota. Database information includes standard physical examination, recording techniques, and treatment processes that had been in place for several years. SETTING: Private practice in United States. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of pudendal neuropathy are treated with PNPIs. Two hours after each block, 2 endpoints are measured: response to a sensory pinprick examination of the pudendal territory and difference in patient-reported pain level before and after nerve block. Fifty-three men from a private practice treating only pelvic pain received the treatment in 2005. Reported pain level was not recorded for 2 patients. RESULTS: Bupivacaine in perineural injections produces varying degrees of analgesia or hypalgesia to pinprick. Normal pinprick response suggests pudendal nerves were not penetrated by bupivacaine. Patient responses varied from complete, i.e. all 6 branches anesthetized to none. Most men had 2 - 5 nerve branches anesthetized. One man had a single nerve branch that responded to bupivacaine. Three men failed to respond to local anesthetic.Changes in pre-PNPI to post-PNPI pain scores were significantly decreased (n = 51, P-value < 0.0001), indicating that bupivacaine in the PNPI reduced pain. Forty-one patients (80.4%) indicated less pain after the procedure and only 2 patients (4.0%) indicated more pain. The number of nerve branches successfully anesthetized was also significantly correlated with change in score. On average, an additional successful nerve branch anesthetized corresponded to a drop of about 0.66 in the change score (n = 51, P - value = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: PNPIs relieve pain. Anesthesia affected all 6 pudendal nerve branches in only 13.2% of patients. Complete pain relief occurred in 39.2%. This argues against use of perineural pudendal blockade as a diagnostic test. Pain relief after PNPI is associated with number of nerve branches that are anesthetized. At 2 hours after a PNPI its quality (the number of the 6 nerve branches with reduced response to pinprick from the perineural local anesthetic) is associated with subjective reduction of pain.

Neuromonitoring methods have been developed to identify and preserve the complex pelvic autonomic nervous system in order to maintain patients' quality of life. So far no randomized study has been published dealing with the role of neuromonitoring in rectal cancer surgery. METHODS/DESIGN: NEUROS is a prospective two-arm randomized controlled multicenter clinical trial comparing the functional outcome in rectal cancer patients undergoing total mesorectal excision (TME) with and without pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring (pIONM). A total of 188 patients will be included. Primary endpoint is the urinary function measured by the International Prostate Symptom Score. Secondary endpoints consist of sexual, anorectal functional outcome and safety, especially oncologic safety and quality of TME. Sexual function is assessed in females with the Female Sexual Function Index and in males with the International Index of Erectile Function. For evaluation of anorectal function the Wexner-Vaizey score is used. Functional evaluation is scheduled before radiochemotherapy (if applicable), preoperatively (baseline), before hospital discharge, 3 and 6 months after stoma closure and 12 months after surgery. For assessment of safety adverse events, the rates of positive resection margins and quality of mesorectum are documented. DISCUSSION: This study will provide high quality evidence on the efficacy of pIONM aiming for improvement of functional outcome in rectal cancer patients undergoing TME.

A retrospective case series of 13 patients.","Adelved A; Tötterman A; Glott T; Hellund JC; Madsen JE; Røise O","Injury","2016","STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. INTRODUCTION: Traumatic lumbosacral dissociation (TLSD) is a rare subgroup of sacral fractures caused by high-energy trauma in healthy adults. There are no accepted treatment algorithms for these injuries. Neurologic deficits and pain are commonly associated with these injuries, however, little is known about the long-term functional outcome in patients with TLSD. The objective of this study was to assess long-term functional outcome in patients with traumatic lumbosacral dissociation (TLSD) injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with TLSD were retrospectively identified and followed with clinical and radiological examination mean 7.7 (3-12) years after the injury. Five were treated operatively, and eight non-operatively. Sensorimotor impairments in the lower extremities were classified according to ASIA. Urinary function was assessed with uroflowmetry, and bowel- and sexual functions were assessed using a structured interview. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and patient-reported health with SF-36. CT images were scrutinized for non-union and kyphotic angulation across the fracture. RESULTS: Eleven patients had neurologic deficits corresponding to L5 and sacral roots. Urinary dysfunction was observed in nine, and bowel dysfunction in three patients. Eight patients reported problems associated with sexual activities, with pain during intercourse and erectile dysfunction being the most common problems. Twelve patients reported pain in the lumbosacral area, in combination with radiating pain in the majority. The overall patient-reported health (SF-36) was significantly lower than the normal population. All sacral fractures were united as seen on CT. Sacral kyphotic angulation was present in 11, which had increased in three patients comparing with the initial radiographs. CONCLUSION: In this long-term follow-up, functional impairments, pain, and poor patient-reported health were common findings among patients with TLSD. High rates of neurologic, urinary and sexual dysfunctions were reported. Extended follow-up several years after the injury with a special focus on urogenital dysfunctions and pain management may be beneficial to these patients.","10.1016/j.injury.2016.04.006","Adult; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Fracture Healing; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Low Back Pain; Lumbosacral Region; Male; Middle Aged; Neuralgia; Norway; Postoperative Pain; Postoperative Complications; Radiculopathy; Radiography; Retrospective Studies; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome; Urologic Diseases; Young Adult","Long-term outcome; Lumbosacral dissociation; Neurologic deficits; Pain; Sacral kyphotic angulation; Sexual dysfunction; U-shaped sacral fractures; Urinary dysfunction","Journal Article"

METHODS: Medline and Embase were searched for articles in which sensory testing, either quantitative sensory testing or current perception thresholds, had been used to evaluate women with pelvic organ prolapse, stress and urge urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence and female sexual dysfunction. All search terms were expanded within each database prior to searching. RESULTS: Research to date has included small numbers of participants, used poorly matched controls, lacked a systemic sensory examination and applied non-standardized sensory testing techniques. However, the evidence suggests women with pelvic organ prolapse demonstrate sensory dysfunction. The role of sensory impairment in stress urinary incontinence is inconclusive. In women with urge urinary incontinence there is some evidence to suggest it may be urethrally mediated. Women with painful bladder syndrome may have more sensitive nerve endings which are unable to ignore repeated stimuli. Sensory impairment is common in women with sexual dysfunction, typically involving larger nerve fibres. There were no studies evaluating sensory function in women with fecal incontinence. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests women with pelvic floor dysfunction demonstrate sensory impairment though the causes remain unclear. Further studies are needed to investigate the different conditions of pelvic floor dysfunction using standardized sensory testing techniques, as well as evaluate the timing and mechanism by which any sensory impairment develops.

AIM: To functionally evaluate the benefits of long-term oral treatment with a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor on the potential capacity of intracavernosal cell therapy to recover erectile function after CNI. METHODS: Bilateral crush CNI (BCNI) was produced in anesthetized male rats. After BCNI, rats were treated with the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor tadalafil (TAD; 5 mg/kg/d orally; BCNI + TAD), a single intracavernosal injection of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs; BCNI + BMSC), or dual therapy (BCNI + BMSC + TAD). Ex vivo function of the corpus cavernosum (CC) and in vivo intracavernosal pressure responses to CN electrical stimulation were evaluated 4 weeks after BCNI. Trichrome staining and terminal 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate nick-end labeling assay were used for fibrosis and apoptosis determination, respectively, in the CC. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In vivo erectile responses in anesthetized rats, ex vivo evaluation of endothelium-dependent relaxation, neurogenic relaxation and neurogenic contraction in CC strips, and histologic evaluation of fibrosis and apoptosis in cavernosal tissue. RESULTS: BCNI resulted in a marked decrease of erectile responses that were partly recovered in the BCNI + TAD and BCNI + BMSC groups. Complete recovery of erectile function was achieved only in the BCNI + BMSC + TAD group. Endothelium-dependent and nitric oxide donor-induced relaxations of the CC were not altered by BCNI or the treatments. BCNI resulted in enhanced neurogenic adrenergic contractions and impaired nitrergic relaxations of the CC. The BCNI + TAD group displayed diminished neurogenic contractions, whereas the BCNI + TAD and BCNI + BMSC groups showed partly recovered nitrergic responses. In the BCNI + BMSC + TAD group, neurogenic contractions were decreased and nitrergic relaxations were normalized. Cavernosal apoptosis and fibrosis were similarly prevented in the BCNI + TAD, BCNI + BMSC, and BCNI + BMSC + TAD groups. CONCLUSION: A dual strategy combining the intracavernosal injection of BMSCs and oral administration of TAD was superior to individual approaches in normalizing neurogenic control of cavernosal tone and preserving erectile function after CNI, suggesting the potential of this dual strategy in the future management of erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy.","10.1016/j.jsxm.2015.12.001","Animals; Combined Modality Therapy; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Nerve Crush; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors; Prostatectomy; Rats; Tadalafil","Cavernous Nerve Injury; Cell Therapy; Corpus Cavernosum; Endothelium-Dependent Relaxation; Erectile Dysfunction; Nitrergic Relaxation; Phosphodiesterase Type 5; Radical Prostatectomy","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

METHODS: Patients at a single center whose medical record allowed precise calculation of time to surgery were included. CES was defined as at least four of the following: bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, lower extremity weakness, lower extremity sensory disturbance, bowel dysfunction, or acute lower back or leg pain. Time to surgery was analyzed as a continuous variable using logistic and ordered logistic regression, and as a discrete variable by comparing patients treated before and after set thresholds. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were identified. Analysis of time as a continuous variable did not reveal any significant association with outcomes. A parsimonious model with adjustment for age, sex, race, acute onset of CES, saddle anesthesia, motor deficit, and bowel dysfunction at presentation was used to analyze the continuous influence of time to surgery on bladder dysfunction and an aggregate outcome of symptoms. Neither time to surgery nor any of the covariates were significantly associated with either outcome. Discrete analysis of outcomes across thresholds of 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours did not reveal prognostic time points. CONCLUSION: In this single-center CES series, time to surgery did not have a convincing continuous or discrete relationship with outcome.

METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with LACC in remission after treatment with NACT + RS (n = 34) or CT/RT (n = 25) were interviewed with an Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7), a Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), and a Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cervical Cancer (EORTC QLQ-CX24) to compare long-term toxicity and QOL. RESULTS: The mean age was 53 ± 9.8 and 59 ± 11.5 years in the NACT + RS and CT/RT groups, respectively. Overall, diarrhea and constipation were reported in 15 and 68%, respectively, while bladder complaints and a low level of sexual enjoyment were reported in 36 and 47%, respectively. The NACT + RS patients showed a worse sexual activity (74.71 ± 33.57 vs. 92.06 ± 17.96; p = 0.019) and sexual enjoyment (71.21 ± 23.67 vs. 88.88 ± 21.71; p = 0.040) and more frequently complained of constipation (49.01 ± 34.06 vs. 26.66 ± 31.66; p = 0.013), while CT/RT patients more frequently suffered from diarrhea (1.96 ± 7.96 vs. 14.66 ± 28.40; p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Many patients treated for LACC have long-term complaints regarding sexual activity and bladder and bowel function. The majority of QOL aspects were similar in the two groups at long-term follow-up.

METHODS: Middle-aged adults with physical disabilities completed a cross-sectional survey that included measures of sexual activity, function, and satisfaction. RESULTS: Consistent with studies of able-bodied adults, sexual function was the strongest predictor of satisfaction. However, depression also predicted sexual satisfaction for women. Use of aids for sexual activity varied by disability type and was generally associated with better function. Lowest levels of sexual satisfaction were reported by men with SCI.

METHODS: In this case series we encountered a group of patients with persistent genital arousal disorder among a larger cohort undergoing a prospective outcomes study on the surgical treatment of symptomatic spinal meningeal cysts. Epidemiologic data were collected and the type, number, and location of the meningeal cysts in each patient were determined on magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperatively patients were asked to self-report whether their persistent genital arousal disorder was eliminated, significantly better, the same, or worse. RESULTS: In a cohort of 1,045 patients with symptomatic spinal meningeal cysts, we identified 11 with persistent genital arousal disorder; all were female and all had meningeal cysts in the sacral spinal canal causing sacral nerve root compression. In addition to persistent genital arousal disorder, all patients had other symptoms typical of sacral nerve root compression such as perineal, bladder, and bowel symptoms. Although multiple types of meningeal cysts were encountered, Tarlov cysts were the most common (8/11). Postoperatively, seven (64%) patients reported elimination of their persistent genital arousal disorder, three (27%) noted significant improvement, one (9%) said they were unchanged, and none experienced worsening with an average follow-up of 23 months ranging from 2 months to 6 years. Although Tarlov cysts were more numerous, the presence of persistent genital arousal disorder and the surgical outcomes appeared unrelated to the type of spinal meningeal cyst treated. CONCLUSION: Our case series suggests that sacral nerve root compression caused by spinal meningeal cysts can cause persistent genital arousal disorder. The presence of nerve root compression appears to be more important than the particular type of meningeal cyst involved. Microsurgical cyst treatment cured or significantly reduced persistent genital arousal disorder symptoms in 91% of the patients.

The potential beneficial effects of surgery for chronic groin pain on dysejaculation are unknown. The objective of this study was to determine dysejaculation rates in a series of patients reporting chronic postherniorrhaphy pain and evaluate the effects of tailored neurectomy on dysejaculation. METHODS: We evaluated male patients (>18 years) operated for chronic groin pain after inguinal herniorrhaphy during a 6-year time period (2004-2010). Dysejaculation was defined as a burning or searing sensation associated with ejaculation. Men reporting symptoms possibly associated with dysejaculation were sent a questionnaire investigating pain characteristics (VAS, 0-100), influence on sex life and effects of the tailored neurectomy. A Post-Herniorrhaphy Dysejaculation Score (PHDS, 0-12 points) was introduced to quantify the severity of the dysejaculation syndrome. RESULTS: A series of 100 males operated for chronic inguinal pain after standard herniorrhaphy were studied. Thirty-four men reported symptoms of dysejaculation prior to the tailored neurectomy. Sex life was negatively influenced in 20 of these, and 5 completely abstained from any sexual activity. Following surgery including tailored neurectomy, funicular release and/or mesh removal, VAS for dysejaculation pain was significantly reduced [n = 20, 55 (95% CI 47-63) versus 21 (95% CI 13-29), p < 0.001]. PHDS scores were also significantly attenuated [n = 20, 10 (3-12) versus 2 (0-10), p < 0.001]. Sex life normalized in two-thirds of these men (13/20). CONCLUSION: Dysejaculation in men suffering from chronic pain after routine inguinal herniorrhaphy is not uncommon. A tailored neurectomy, funicular release and/or mesh removal offer relief in the majority of these patients.","10.1007/s10029-015-1410-5","Adult; Aged; Chronic Pain; Denervation; Ejaculation; Groin; Hernia, Inguinal; Herniorrhaphy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuralgia; Pain Measurement; Postoperative Pain; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Surveys and Questionnaires","Dysejaculation; Herniorrhaphy; Mesh; Neurectomy; Post-Herniorrhaphy Dysejaculation Score","Journal Article"

AIM: This study aimed to use both quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the impact of secondary health conditions on the experiences of people with spinal cord injury (SCI) who have returned to community living, in the context of Australia's National Disability Strategy and recently launched NDIS. Exploration of lived experience of health conditions following SCI utilising this mixed methods approach may offer important insights for effective planning within an NDIS. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using the Spinal Cord Injury Secondary Conditions Scale (SCISCS), demographic questionnaire and in-depth interview was undertaken with 33 people with SCI living in the community. Demographic and SCISCS data were reported using descriptive statistics. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Participants were on average 58.5 years of age and 20 years post-injury. Five key themes emerged relating to (i) spasm and pain; (ii) sexual dysfunction; (iii) pressure areas; (iv) fatigue; and (v) the impact of secondary health conditions on life role participation and choice of supports and equipment. CONCLUSION: Secondary health conditions can significantly impact occupational participation following SCI. Appropriate intervention, including customised equipment and direct support, if delivered as part of an effective NDIS, may prevent or reduce the severity of these conditions and offer the potential to influence health and participation outcomes of people who have returned to community living.","10.1111/1440-1630.12206","Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Australia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disability Evaluation; Persons with Disabilities; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Middle Aged; Neuralgia; Pain Measurement; Patient Satisfaction; Patient-Centered Care; Rehabilitation Centers; Self-Assessment; Spinal Cord Injuries","health promotion; mixed methods research; spinal cord injury","Journal Article"

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) in improving erectile function in a rat model of cavernous nerve (CN) cryoinjury and the possible mechanisms. Male rats were intracavernous (IC) injected with EdU-labeled ADSC after bilateral CN cryoinjury. Penile tissues were harvested for histology and protein level detection at 1 and 4 weeks after ADSC administration. Erectile function was assessed prior to tissue harvest. We found that erectile function was significantly improved after ADSC treatment via promoting nNOS-positive nerve regeneration and cavernous tissue recovery. The expression of cleaved caspase 3 (an apoptotic marker) reduced after ADSC treatment. Although few EdU-labeled ADSCs were visualized within the penis 4 weeks after administration, plenty of EdU-labeled ADSCs were found around penile dorsal vessels and nerves 1 week after treatment. Furthermore, three neurotrophic factors (NGF, VEGF, and Neurturin) were significantly decreased in Cryo group, and were partially recovered 1 week after ADSC injection. These results suggested that IC injection of ADSC resulted in substantial recoveries of erectile function after CN cryoinjury. The effects may be achieved through the elevated level of neurotrophic factors in penile tissue and subsequent neuroregenerative effects.","10.1111/andr.12047","Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cryotherapy; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Male; Nerve Growth Factor; Nerve Regeneration; Neurturin; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Random Allocation; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stem Cell Transplantation; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","adipose-derived stem cells; cavernous nerve cryoinjury; erectile dysfunction; neuroregeneration","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

DESIGN: In vivo animal study. POPULATION: Thirty Sprague-Dawley female rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female rats underwent either unilateral pelvic nerve (PN) crush (PNC; n = 9), or crush of both the PNs and all efferent nerves in the pelvic plexus ('clock-nerve crush', CNC; n = 9). Under anaesthesia, we electrically stimulated the crushed PN at 3 and 10 days after crush while monitoring blood pressure and recording clitoral and vaginal blood flows by laser Doppler. Uninjured PNs were stimulated as an internal control. Twelve additional rats were assigned either to bilateral PNC or sham surgery, and genital tissues were processed 10 days after injury for in vitro analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genital blood flow, nNOS, eNOS, collagen I-III. RESULTS: Stimulation of the crushed PN in both groups subjected to PNC and CNC induced significantly lower peak genital blood flow at 3 and 10 days (P < 0.05) compared to stimulation of the non-crushed control PN. The immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses revealed that all injured rats exhibited more vaginal collagen III and collagen I than rats did that ad undergone sham surgeries (P < 0.05). PCN reduced nNOS expression in both clitoral and vaginal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study it may be hypothesised that NSRH might cause reductions of genital blood flow and vaginal fibrosis due to neurapraxia of the pelvic nerve and reductions of nNOS nerve fibres in clitoral and distal vaginal tissue.

These disorders include mainly polyneuropathies (particularly those affecting the autonomic nervous system (ANS)) and localized lesions affecting the innervation of genital organs. Impaired neural control may produce a malfunction of the genital response consisting of loss of genital sensitivity, erectile dysfunction, loss of vaginal lubrication, ejaculation disorder, and orgasmic disorder. In addition, there is often a loss of desire which actually has a complex pathogenesis, which goes beyond the mere loss of relevant nerve function. In patients who have no manifest health problems - particularly men with erectile dysfunction - one should always consider the possibility of an underlying polyneuropathy; in patients with SD after suspected denervation lesions of the innervation of genital organs within the lumbosacral spinal canal and in the pelvis, clinical neurophysiologic testing may clarify the PNS involvement. SD can alter self-esteem and lower patients' quality of life; opening up a discussion on sexual issues should be a part of the management of patients with PNS disorders.

The end point of SC development is the formation of myelinating and nonmyelinating cells which ensheath large and small diameter axons, respectively. They play an important role in axon regeneration after injury, including cavernous nerve injury that leads to erectile dysfunction (ED). Despite improvement in radical prostatectomy surgical techniques, many patients still suffer from ED postoperatively as surgical trauma causes traction injuries and local inflammatory changes in the neuronal microenvironment of the autonomic fibers innervating the penis resulting in pathophysiological alterations in the end organ. The aim of this review is to summarize contemporary evidence regarding: (1) the origin and development of SCs in the peripheral and penile nerve system; (2) Wallerian degeneration and SC plastic change following peripheral and penile nerve injury; (3) how SCs promote peripheral and penile nerve regeneration by secreting neurotrophic factors; (4) and strategies targeting SCs to accelerate peripheral nerve regeneration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of 10 rats each: group 1, sham operation; group 2, cavernous nerve injury; group 3, SPION-MSC treatment after cavernous nerve injury. Immediately after the cavernous nerve injury in group 3, SPION-MSCs were injected into the cavernous nerve injured cavernosa. Serial T2-weighted MRI was done immediately after injection and at 2 and 4 weeks. Erectile response was assessed by cavernous nerve stimulation at 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: Prussian blue staining of SPION-MSCs revealed abundant uptake of SPION in the cytoplasm. After injection of 1×10(6) SPION-MSCs into the cavernosa of rats, T2-weighted MRI showed a clear hypointense signal induced by the injection. The presence of SPION in the corpora cavernosa was confirmed with Prussian blue staining. At 2 and 4 weeks, rats with cavernous nerve injury had significantly lower erectile function than did rats without cavernous nerve injury (p<0.05). The group transplanted with SPION-MSCs showed higher erectile function than did the group without SPION-MSCs (p<0.05). The presence of SPION-MSCs for up to 4 weeks was confirmed by MRI imaging and Prussian blue staining in the corpus cavernosa. CONCLUSIONS: Transplanted SPION-MSCs existed for up to 4 weeks in the cavernous nerve injured cavernosa of rats. Erectile dysfunction recovered and could be monitored by MRI.","10.4111/kju.2015.56.4.280","Animals; Contrast Media; Dextrans; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Delivery Systems; Erectile Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Monitoring, Physiologic; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats; Suspensions; Treatment Outcome","Erectile dysfunction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; Nanoparticles","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The relative animal studies provide important clues to design pre-clinical studies and clinical studies further in the future. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the effects and influential factors of stem cell transplantation on ED rats with CNI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed and EBSCO databases published before April 30, 2014 for pre-clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of stem cell transplantation in the treatment of ED rats with CNI. A systematic review and a planned subgroup analysis were performed to identify whether or not some certain influential factors could bring significant effects on stem cell treatment. RESULTS: 12 studies with 319 rats were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Pooled analysis results confirmed the efficacy of stem cell transplantation. Subgroup analysis results showed that treatment effects were not related to CNI models, follow-up time, stem cell species, stem cell sources, markers and delivery approaches in the transplantation. Uncultured stem cells were poorly effective compared with cultured stem cells. Periprostatic implantation (PPI) with acellular scaffolds could promote cavernous nerve regeneration, but was less effective for smooth muscle cell recovery. Stem cells modified by NGF or BDNF combined with udenafil/bFGF seemed to be more effective than those modified by BDNF alone. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that stem cell therapy can be performed to recover erectile function. Future studies should focus on nerve restoration and vascular cell recovery. The synergistic actions of multiple growth factors following stem cell transplantation should also be considered as beneficial strategies to obtain preferable effects.","10.1371/journal.pone.0121428","Animals; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Databases, Factual; Erectile Dysfunction; Male; Nerve Growth Factor; Penile Erection; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stem Cells","","Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Review"

Research which has looked at the intersection of disability and male gender has largely treated disabled men as a homogeneous group with little reference to, for example, impairment-related differences. The ongoing move towards self-directed, personalised social care in England suggests that support needs relating to gender may be taken more seriously. A qualitative study with 20 men with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in England in 2013 explored the men's experiences of the organisation and delivery of social care as it pertained to their sense of being men. Our main finding was that social care in its broadest sense did little to support a positive sense of masculinity or male gender. More often than not the organisation and delivery of social care people de-gendered or emasculated many of the men who took part in the study. Our paper speaks to the need to explore impairment-specific issues for disabled men; to deliver a more person-centred approach to social care which recognises the importance of the social and sexual lives of disabled men; and to create ways in which men can support and empower each other to assert essential human rights relating to independence, dignity and liberty.","10.1111/hsc.12222","Persons with Disabilities; England; Humans; Male; Masculinity; Middle Aged; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Qualitative Research; Sexual Behavior","Duchenne muscular dystrophy; male gender; masculinity; social care","Journal Article"

Rats in the latter three groups underwent bilateral CN injury prior to injection. The evaluation of erectile function and histomorphometric studies were performed 4 weeks after injection. The ratio of maximal intracavernous pressure to mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the control group than in the sham group (0.18 vs. 0.56, p < .001). Intracavernous injection of SVF (0.36, p = .035) significantly improved erectile function compared with that in the control group, whereas the ADSC group (0.35, p = .052) showed marginally significant improvement. The smooth muscle/collagen ratio, smooth muscle content, number of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase-positive nerve fibers, and expression of von Willebrand factor were significantly higher in the SVF and ADSC groups than in the control group. Expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase was significantly increased in the SVF group. The increases in the smooth muscle/collagen ratio and von Willebrand factor expression were larger in the SVF group than in the ADSC group.

DESIGN: A step-by-step explanation of the patient's condition, diagnosis, surgical technique, and postoperative results using video, pictures, and medical illustrations (education video). SETTING: TVT retropubic slings have become the gold standard for the treatment of stress urine incontinence over the last decade. Despite high cure rates, the TVT is not without potential complications. Typical complications include urine retention, incomplete bladder emptying, frequency, urgency, urethral erosion, vaginal extrusion, vaginal pain, and dyspareunia. The most common complication for sling removal/revision is chronic pain. The TVT obturator neuralgia is a rare and specific type of chronic pain that is normally associated with transobturator tape slings. The purpose of this video is to present an extremely rare complication of TVT retropubic slings, present symptoms and signs of obturator nerve compression, show the normal and the actual position of this patient's TVT sling, describe the laparoscopic removal of the TVT sling, and present the postoperative course and resolution of the patient's pain. The patient signed a release for her video to be used for educational and teaching purposes. INTERVENTION: A combined transvaginal and laparoscopic approach in a patient with lower abdominal, levator, and obturator-type pain after a TVT retropubic procedure. CONCLUSION: In patients suffering from obturator neuralgia after a retropubic sling, surgeons should include the sling as a potential causative factor in the differential diagnosis. Surgeons should consider removing the sling based on the patient's symptoms. If the patient suffers from only vaginal pain and dyspareunia, then the surgeon should consider only the removal of the vaginal portion of the sling. In patients with obturator neuralgia, retropubic, and/or lower abdominal pain, one should consider a combined transvaginal and laparoscopic approach in an attempt to remove the majority of the sling and release tension between 2 points of fixation.","10.1016/j.jmig.2015.02.015","Device Removal; Dyspareunia; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Neuralgia; Postoperative Period; Suburethral Slings; Urethra; Urinary Incontinence, Stress; Urinary Retention; Vagina","Mesh complications; Obturator neuralgia; Tension-free vaginal tape","Case Reports; Journal Article; Video-Audio Media"

In animal models of peripheral nerve injury, glial growth factor-2 (GGF2), a member of the neuregulin family of growth factors, has neuroprotective and neurorestorative properties, but this potential has not been established after cavernous nerve (CN) injury. AIMS: The effectiveness of GGF2 in preserving axonal integrity and recovering erectile function in a rat model of radical prostatectomy-associated CN injury. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent bilateral CN crush injury (BCNI) or sham surgery. Rats were administered GGF2 (0.5, 5, or 15 mg/kg) or vehicle subcutaneously 24 hour pre and 24-hour post-BCNI, and once weekly for 5 weeks. Erectile function was assessed in response to electrical stimulation of the CN. CN survival was assessed by fluorogold retrograde axonal tracing in major pelvic ganglia (MPG). Unmyelinated axons in the CNs were quantitated by electron microscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erectile function recovery, CN survival, and unmyelinated CN axon preservation in response to GGF2 treatment following BCNI. RESULTS: Erectile function was decreased (P < 0.05) after BCNI, and it was improved (P < 0.05) by all doses of GGF2. The number of fluorogold-labeled cells in the MPG was reduced (P < 0.05) by BCNI and was increased (P < 0.05) by GGF2 (0.5 and 5 mg/kg). The percentage of denervated Schwann cells in the BCNI group was higher (P < 0.05) than that in the sham-treated group and was decreased (P < 0.05) in the GGF2-treated (5 mg/kg) BCNI group. In the BCNI + GGF2 (5 mg/kg) group, the unmyelinated fiber histogram demonstrated a rightward shift, indicating an increased number of unmyelinated axons per Schwann cell compared with the BCNI group. CONCLUSIONS: GGF2 promotes erectile function recovery following CN injury in conjunction with preserving unmyelinated CN fibers.

METHODS: The clinical features of autonomic dysfunction were collected as follows: dermal numbness or pruritus, parahidrosis, xerostomia, salivation, abnormal skin temperature, orthostatic hypotension, mydriasis, ptosis or abnormal pupillary light reflex, constipation, voiding dysfunction and sexual dysfunction. SSR was performed and the results were judged according to the normal range of our laboratory. Abnormality rate in MND patients was calculated. The relationship between clinical symptoms and SSR parameters were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Among a total of 142 MND patients, the symptom incidences of autonomic dysfunction were as follows: dermal numbness (53.5%), dermal pruritus (15.5%), parahidrosis (10.6%), xerostomia (9.1%), salivation (2.1%), abnormal skin temperature (14.8%), orthostatic hypotension (2.1%), constipation (16.2%), voiding dysfunction (9.9%) and sexual dysfunction (1.4%). Abnormal SSR was found in 51/142 (35.9%) patients, including 12(8.5%) in palmar and 47(33.1%) in plantar. The features of abnormal SSR included delayed latency of palmar (P < 0.05) and decreased amplitudes of both palmar and plantar compared with normal ranges (P < 0.01 respectively). The group of patients with lumbosacral onset had a higher abnormal rate of SSR than those of other onset sites. There was no significant correlation between clinical symptoms and abnormal SSR parameters. CONCLUSION: The patients of MND exhibit autonomic dysfunctions of skin, gland secretion, cardiovascular system and sphincters. Some of them show abnormal SSR with prolonged latency and decreased amplitude. The abnormalities of SSR are not related to clinical features of autonomic dysfunction.

Oxidative stress was evaluated by malondialdehyde levels, super oxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities in serum. Erectile function was assessed by CN electrostimulation at 3 months with mean maximal intracavernous pressure (ICP) and maximal ICP per mean arterial pressure. Nerve injury was assessed by toluidine blue staining of CNs and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase staining of penile tissue. GPX protein expression and nitrotyrosine-3 (NT-3) levels in penile tissue were measured. Erectile function and the number of myelinated axons of CNs and NADPH-diaphorase-positive nerve fibers were statistically decreased between groups, from sham to crush to transection. For markers, both nerve-injury groups showed increased oxidative stress markers at early time points, with the transection group showing greater oxidative stress than the crushed group and values normalizing to sham levels by week 12. GPX expression and NT-3 levels in penile tissue were in concordance with the results of SOD and GPX. These results show that oxidative stress plays an important role in injured CNs, and different methods of CN injury can lead to different degrees of oxidative stress in a rat model.","10.1002/jnr.23545","Analysis of Variance; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Glutathione Peroxidase; Male; Malondialdehyde; NADPH Dehydrogenase; Oxidative Stress; Penile Erection; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Superoxide Dismutase","cavernous nerve; erectile dysfunction; oxidative stress","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

STUDY DESIGN: A randomized trial among women with pelvic floor myalgia (PFM) was performed wherein participants received either PT or LTPI. Pain was assessed and 1 month posttreatment completion. Levator-based pain was assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS) and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scale. Sexual function was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). RESULTS: Twenty-nine women completed the study (17 had PT, 12 had LTPI). Both groups reported reduction in vaginal pain: mean NRS change from baseline of 4.47 [standard deviation (SD) 2.12) for PT and 4.67 (SD 1.72) for LTPI (p = 0.8)]. A >50 % improvement in NRS was documented among 59 % of women receiving PT and 58 % receiving LTPI (p = 1.0). Consistent with NRS scores, mean PGI-I score was 2.50 (SD 1.17) for PT and 2.17 (SD 1.01) for LTPI (p = 0.5). Mean change in FSFI favored PT [PT +8.87 (SD 5.60), LTPI +4.00 (SD 5.24), p = 0.04], reflecting improvement in the sexual pain domain favoring PT (p = 0.02). However, the time in weeks to effect improvement favored LTPI if controlling for the degree of change in NRS (p = 0.01) and FSFI (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal myalgia and sex-related pain improved with pelvic floor PT and LTPI.

A 43-year-old right-handed Nigerian man was referred to our centre with rapidly progressive neurological decline. He presented initially with weight loss, confusion, fatigue, and urinary and erectile dysfunction. He then suffered recurrent episodes of slurred speech with right-sided weakness. He went on to develop hearing difficulties and painless paraesthesia. Neurological examination revealed horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, brisk jaw jerk, increased tone, brisk reflexes throughout and bilateral heel-shin ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a raised protein of 6.4 g/dl. Nerve conduction studies showed an axonal neuropathy. Echocardiography was characteristic of cardiac amyloid. TTR gene sequencing showed that he was heterozygous for the leucine 12 proline mutation. Meningeal and brain biopsy confirmed widespread amyloid angiopathy. TTR amyloidosis is a rare cause of leptomeningeal enhancement, but should be considered if there is evidence of peripheral or autonomic neuropathy with cardiac or ocular involvement. The relationship between different TTR mutations and clinical phenotype, disease course, and response to treatment remains unclear.","10.1007/s00415-014-7594-2","Adult; Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial; Humans; Leucine; Male; Meninges; Mutation; Nigeria; Proline","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

METHODS: The clinical phenotype and the level of relevant biochemical markers were assessed. To determine the number of CAG repeats in the exon 1 of androgen receptor (AR) gene, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the family members, amplified by PCR and identified by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The proband showed predominantly proximal limb weakness, fasciculation, muscle atrophy, gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction and increased serum creatine kinase. Myopathy and neuropathy were identified by electromyography. Two other affected males and 2 affected female carriers were identified to carry an expanded CAG repeat in the AR gene. The numbers of CAG repeats were found to be 43 in the proband, 43 and 42 in the other two affected males, one of which had similar clinical symptoms to the proband.

METHODS: Twenty adult rats were divided into 4 groups: (a) sham, (b) control--bilateral cavernosal nerve crush injury (BCNI), (c) BCNI + low-dose pioglitazone (PioL), and (d) BCNI + high-dose pioglitazone (PioH). Sham and control rats were administered phosphate-buffered saline, whereas PioL and PioH rats received 0.65 and 6.5 mg/kg of pioglitazone, respectively. All treatments were administered by oral gavage for 14 days. After treatment, animals underwent surgery for endpoint cavernosal response to define hemodynamic parameters of erectile function, reported as the ratio of intracavernosal pressure to mean arterial pressure. Corporal tissue was retrieved for histologic and molecular analysis. RESULTS: Animals treated with pioglitazone experienced dose-dependent improvements in the ratio of intracavernosal pressure to mean arterial pressure, with the PioH group achieving results similar to the sham group: sham, 0.774; BCNI, 0.421; PioL, 0.616; PioH, 0.758 (P = .0006). PioH animals demonstrated increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide (nNOS), whereas both PioL and PioH animals had increased staining for anti--smooth muscle actin antibody and nonsignificant increases in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).

Penile hypoxia after RP is thought to significantly contribute to ED pathogenesis. AIM: We previously showed that corpora cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs) undergo phenotypic modulation under hypoxic conditions in vitro. Here, we studied such changes in an in vivo post-RP ED model by investigating CCSMCs in bilateral cavernous neurectomy (BCN) rats. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sham (n = 12) or BCN (n = 12) surgery. After 12 weeks, they were injected with apomorphine to determine erectile function. The penile tissues were harvested and assessed for fibrosis using Masson trichrome staining and for molecular markers of phenotypic modulation using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. CCSMC morphological structure was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: Erectile function was significantly lower in BCN rats than in sham rats. BCN increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and collagen protein expression in corpora cavernous tissue. H&E staining and TEM showed that CCSMCs in BCN rats underwent hypertrophy and showed rough endoplasmic reticulum formation. The expression of CCSMC phenotypic markers, such as smooth muscle α-actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, and desmin, was markedly lower, whereas vimentin protein expression was significantly higher in BCN rats than in control rats. CONCLUSIONS: CCSMCs undergo phenotype modulation in rats with cavernous neurectomy. The results have unveiled physiological transformations that occur at the cellular and molecular levels and have helped characterize CN injury-induced ED.","10.1371/journal.pone.0105186","Animals; Erectile Dysfunction; Fibrillar Collagens; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Male; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prostatectomy; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Sex differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statins contribute to interindividual variations in drug efficacy and toxicity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of sexual dimorphism in the efficacy and safety of simvastatin/atorvastatin treatment. METHODS: Lipid levels of 495 patients (331 women and 164 men) were measured at baseline and after 6 ± 3 months of simvastatin/atorvastatin treatment to assess the efficacy and safety profiles of both drugs. RESULTS: Women had higher baseline levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with men (p < 0.0001). After treatment, women exhibited a greater decrease in plasma TC and LDL-C levels compared with men. After adjustment for covariates, baseline levels of TC and LDL-C influenced more than 30% of the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy (p < 0.001), regardless of sex. Myalgia [with or without changes in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels] occurred more frequently in women (25.9%; p = 0.002), whereas an increase in CPK and/or abnormal liver function was more frequent in in men (17.9%; p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that baseline TC and LDL-C levels are the main predictors of simvastatin/atorvastatin therapy efficacy, regardless of sex. In addition, they suggest the presence of sexual dimorphism in the safety of simvastatin/atorvastatin. The effect of sex differences on receptors, transporter proteins, and gene expression pathways needs to be better evaluated and characterized to confirm these observations.","10.5935/abc.20140085","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anticholesteremic Agents; Atorvastatin; Brazil; Cholesterol; Creatine Kinase; Female; Heptanoic Acids; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Hypolipidemic Agents; Lipoproteins, HDL; Lipoproteins, LDL; Male; Middle Aged; Myalgia; Prospective Studies; Pyrroles; Sex Factors; Simvastatin","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
"25082919","Pelvic-floor muscle rehabilitation in erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.","Lavoisier P; Roy P; Dantony E; Watrelot A; Ruggeri J; Dumoulin S","Physical therapy","2014","BACKGROUND: In men, involuntary or voluntary ischiocavernosus muscle contractions after erection lead to intracavernous blood pressures far higher than the systolic pressure, which builds and maintains penile rigidity. Thus, erectile dysfunction may be partly due to ischiocavernosus muscle atrophy and may be treated by rehabilitation interventions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether pelvic-floor muscle strengthening interventions could be associated with increases in intracavernous pressure that would increase penile rigidity. DESIGN: An observational study was conducted. METHODS: One hundred twenty-two men with isolated erectile dysfunction and 108 men with isolated premature ejaculation participated (no neuromuscular diseases or previous perineal rehabilitation). Thirty-minute sessions of voluntary contractions coupled with electrical stimulation were designed to increase ischiocavernosus muscle strength (monitored through intracavernous pressure increase). A linear mixed-effects model per group analyzed separately, then jointly, the maximum change in pressure (ΔP) and the maximum baseline (ie, respectively, the average contraction-generated difference in intracavernous pressure and the intracavernous pressure plateau at full erection, both measured during the highest moving average of the best 2 minutes of each session). RESULTS: Over 20 sessions, the maximum ΔP increased in erectile dysfunction as well as in premature ejaculation (87% and 88%, respectively, in men with positive trends). The maximum baseline also increased (99% and 72%, respectively, in men with positive trends). The joint modeling indicated that the mean expected progressions of the intracavernous pressure after 5 sessions in erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation were 62.85 and 64.15 cm H2O, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Indirect measurements were obtained of intracavernous pressure and ischiocavernosus muscle force. CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic-floor muscle rehabilitation was found to be beneficial in erectile dysfunction. However, its effects on symptoms of premature ejaculation, despite intracavernous pressure gains, were much more difficult to assess. The definitive proof of its benefits requires rather difficult-to-design clinical trials.","10.2522/ptj.20130354","Adult; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Rigidity; Muscle, Smooth; Pelvic Floor; Penis; Premature Ejaculation","","Journal Article; Observational Study"

METHODS: Using the relationship between the cysts and SNRF, SESMCs were divided into two types: cysts with SNRF known as Tarlov cysts and cysts without. If the SESMCs were identified as those without SNRFs, the neck of the cyst was transfixed, ligated and the remaining cyst wall removed distal to the clip. The improved Japanese Orthopedic Association (IJOA) scoring system was used to evaluate preoperative and postoperative neurological functions of the patients. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were included in this study. The average age was 42.7 ± 11.93 years. The mean preoperative IJOA score was 17.5 ± 2.47, and postoperative IJOA score was 19.1 ± 1.41. The difference between preoperative and postoperative IJOA scores was statistically significant (t = -3.75, P = 0.001), with a significant improvement in neurological function after surgery. Among the improvements in neurological function, the most significant was bowel/bladder function (z = -2.33, P = 0.02).

We also investigated the etiology of the low signal referring to the pathology of one autopsy case. METHODS: This retrospective magnetic resonance (MR) study included 23 ALS patients and 28 age-matched normal controls. The signal intensity of the motor cortex was scored by SWI, conventional T2-weighted images and T2*-weighted images. A postmortem study of one patient was also performed. RESULTS: On SWI, there was a significant difference between the precentral cortical signal intensity scores in the ALS patients and the controls (P < .0001). The total scores of signal intensities of the precentral cortex were positively correlated with age in the normal controls (r = .494), but no correlation was observed in the ALS patients. The postmortem study showed intensely stained microglias and macrophages after antiferritin antibody staining in the precentral cortices. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased signal intensity of the motor cortex on SWI may serve a useful role in ALS diagnoses, particularly in young patients.

PGAD is not well understood, and no definitive cause has been determined. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the disorder and to seek commonalities between cases of PGAD encountered in a chronic pain management clinic. METHOD: We reviewed a cohort of 15 women with PGAD who presented to a chronic non-cancer pain clinic in a large urban tertiary teaching hospital that provides pelvic and genital pain management. We conducted a series of interviews to examine medical history, history of presenting illness, and management. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the data. RESULTS: Findings were largely consistent with previous research on PGAD regarding symptomatology and aggravating and alleviating factors. Symptoms of genital pain, depression, and interstitial cystitis were found in over one half of the patients in this cohort. Previous antidepressant use, restless legs syndrome, and pudendal neuralgia were found in a number of cases. Pelvic varices and Tarlov cysts have been previously identified as possible contributors to PGAD, but these were not a common finding in our cohort. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to build on the current understanding of PGAD. Patients should be asked about persistent arousal as part of a sexual and reproductive history, especially in the case of common comorbidities. Objectif : Le syndrome d’excitation génitale persistante (SEGP) a été identifié comme étant une excitation génitale souvent non provoquée qui est associée à un degré de détresse considérable. Le SEGP n’est pas bien compris et aucune cause définitive ne lui a été attribuée. Cette étude avait pour but d’améliorer la compréhension de ce syndrome et de tenter d’établir des points communs entre les cas de SEGP constatés au sein d’une clinique de maîtrise de la douleur chronique. Méthode : Nous avons analysé une cohorte de 15 femmes aux prises avec le SEGP qui ont consulté une clinique de maîtrise de la douleur chronique n’étant pas attribuable au cancer, au sein d’un hôpital universitaire tertiaire urbain de grande envergure qui offre des services de maîtrise de la douleur pelvienne et génitale. Nous avons mené une série d’entrevues visant à examiner les antécédents médicaux, l’historique de la maladie en question et la prise en charge. Nous avons eu recours aux principes de la statistique descriptive pour examiner les données. Résultats : Nos constatations se sont en grande partie inscrites dans la suite logique des résultats obtenus par les efforts de recherche précédents ayant porté sur le SEGP, en ce qui a trait à la symptomatologie et aux facteurs aggravants et atténuants. Des symptômes de douleur génitale, de dépression et de cystite interstitielle ont été constatés chez plus de la moitié des patientes de cette cohorte. Des antécédents en matière d’utilisation d’antidépresseurs, de syndrome des jambes sans repos et de névralgie pudendale ont été constatés dans un certain nombre de cas. Des varices pelviennes et des kystes de Tarlov ont déjà été identifiés comme étant de possibles facteurs contribuant au SEGP; toutefois, leur présence n’a pas été fréquemment signalée au sein de notre cohorte. Conclusion : La tenue d’autres recherches s’avère requise pour enrichir notre compréhension actuelle du SEGP.

In the literature the most investigated sphincter dysfunction is the urinary. Bowel and sexual function are often overlooked since they become more relevant after the acute phase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight consecutive male patients affected by cauda equina syndrome with sphincter dysfunction due to herniated disc disease of lumbar spine were treated between 2007 and 2009. Five patients were followed-up for at least two years. Sexual function was evaluated by IIEF-5 questionnaire; bowel function was investigated by means of clinical and instrumental investigation and manometry. RESULTS: Although little clinical improved, patients still complained severe symptoms at first year follow-up while all but one improved significantly in the following year. At two years follow-up only the patient whose cauda equina syndrome was misdiagnosed and surgically treated late respect to the onset of the syndrome, complained a persistent severe sexual and bowel dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a long-term follow-up is mandatory to evaluate the real outcome of surgical managed cauda equine syndrome because short-term evaluation could be misleading about the residual capacity of late neurologic improving.

Part A","2014","Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most frequent long-term problem after radical prostatectomy. We aimed to evaluate whether the use of combination therapy with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-hydrogel on corpus cavernosum and with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-immobilized poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) membrane on the cavernous nerve (CN) could improve erectile function in a rat model of bilateral cavernous nerve crush injury (BCNI). Rats were randomly divided into five groups (n=15 per group): a normal group (N group), a group receiving saline application after bilateral cavernous nerve crush injury (BCNI), a group undergoing bFGF-hydrogel injection in the corpus cavernosum after BCNI (bFGF), a group receiving ADSC application covered with BDNF-membrane after BCNI (ADSC/BDNF), and a group undergoing coadministration of bFGF-hydrogel injection and BDNF-membrane with ADSCs after BDNF (bFGF+ADSC/BDNF). Four weeks postoperatively, the erectile function was assessed by detecting the ratio of intracavernous pressure (ICP) to mean arterial pressure (MAP). Smooth muscle and collagen contents were measured using Masson's trichrome staining. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in the dorsal penile nerve was detected by immunostaining. The protein expression of the α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level of the corpus cavernosum were quantified by western blot and cGMP assay, respectively. In the bFGF+ADSC/BDNF group, the erectile function was significantly elevated compared with the BCNI and other treated groups and showed a significantly increased smooth muscle/collagen ratio, nNOS content, α-SMA expression, and cGMP level. In particular, there were no statistical differences in the ICP/MAP ratio, smooth muscle/collagen ratio, and α-SMA and cGMP levels between the bFGF+ADSC/BDNF group and normal group. Application of the BDNF-immobilized PLGA membrane with human ADSC into the CN and bFGF-incorporated hydrogel into the corpus carvernosum improved nearly normal erectile function in a rat model of postprostatectomy ED.

Neuropathic pain (NP) may facilitate ED, because it is frequently associated with anxiety, depression, and its drug, pregabalin, may also contribute ED. AIM: The objective of this study was to determine whether pregabalin treatment for patients with neuropathic pain promotes erectile dysfunction. METHODS: The study sample consisted of a total of 102 male subjects that were subdivided into three groups. Group 1 patients (n = 31) had a pre-existing diagnosis of NP and was treated with 300 mg/day of pregabalin for at least 3 months. Group 2 patients (n = 34) were diagnosed with NP for at least 3 months; however, neither were they treated with pregabalin nor did they received physical therapy throughout the study. Lastly, healthy age-matched control subjects comprised group 3 (n = 37). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients in all groups completed the International Index for Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean age and mean body mass index did not differ significantly between each of the three groups. The cause of NP and the mean duration of having a diagnosis of NP did not differ significantly in groups 1 and 2. However, IIEF scores were significantly lower for group 1 when compared to group 2 in terms of erectile function, orgasmic function, overall satisfaction and total score. Yet groups 1 and 2 did not diverge significantly in the intercourse satisfaction and sexual desire scores. Overall IIEF scores for group 3 were significantly higher than those of group 2 except for mean erectile function scores. CONCLUSION: Taking pregabalin for the treatment of neuropathic pain poses an increased risk for developing ED in male patients. Thus, clinicians prescribing pregabalin to patients diagnosed with neuropathic pain should assess for ED before and during treatment with this medication.","10.1111/jsm.12458","Adult; Analgesics; Coitus; Depression; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Libido; Male; Neuralgia; Patient Satisfaction; Pregabalin; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","Erectile Dysfunction; Neuropathic Pain; Pregabalin","Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial"

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 108 women with DIE underwent conventional surgery (group A, n=63) and nerve-sparing surgery (group B, n=45). Three validated interview-based questionnaires - the visual analogue scale (VAS), the international prostate score symptom (IPSS), and the female sexual function index (FSFI) - were used to evaluate the efficacy and associated complications. RESULTS: The VAS scores significantly decreased in both groups A and B after surgery, although two patients (4.4%) in group B had no improvement in their pain symptoms. The total FSFI and each domain scores significantly increased in the two groups after surgery except for satisfaction at the 24-month follow up in group A. Nine patients (15.9%) in group A required self-catheterization postoperatively. Based on the IPSS scores, a significant alteration in voiding symptoms in group A was observed at 6 months but not at 12 months or 24 months after surgery. In group B, however, no significant difference or self-catheterization requirement was observed after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced bladder and sexual dysfunction, but with a risk of absence of pain relief, suggests that the pros and cons of nerve-sparing surgery for DIE should carefully be evaluated before operation.","10.1016/j.ejogrb.2014.01.027","Adult; Endometriosis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gynecologic Surgical Procedures; Humans; Middle Aged; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Urination Disorders","Deeply infiltrating endometriosis; Female sexual function index; International prostate score symptom; Nerve-sparing surgery; Visual analogue scale","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The secondary purpose was to study whether symptoms of nerve dysfunction were related to traction time. METHODS: From March to October 2010, 52 consecutive patients-27 male patients (mean age, 40 years; range, 21 to 63 years) and 25 female patients (mean age, 37 years; range, 15 to 60 years), underwent HA with labral repair, rim trimming, and osteoplasty. The patients received a follow-up questionnaire 1 year after HA concerning symptoms of nerve dysfunction, possible localization, and erectile dysfunction. Fifty patients participated and returned fully completed questionnaires. Patients reporting symptoms of nerve dysfunction 1 year after HA were re-examined. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 50 patients (46%) reported symptoms of nerve dysfunction during the first week after HA; this was reduced to 14 patients (28%) after 6 weeks, 11 patients (22%) after 26 weeks, and 9 patients (18%) after 1 year. One patient experienced temporary erectile dysfunction. No difference in traction time between patients with symptoms of nerve dysfunction (n = 23) and patients without (n = 27) was found (98 minutes v 100 minutes; P = .88). CONCLUSIONS: Forty-six percent of patients undergoing HA reported symptoms of nerve dysfunction within the first 6 weeks after surgery. One year postoperatively, these symptoms remained in only 18% of all patients. Traction time during surgery was not different in patients with and those without symptoms of nerve dysfunction.

"24449801","Experiences of sexuality and intimacy in terminal illness: a phenomenological study.","Taylor B","Palliative medicine","2014","BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of research considering sexuality and intimacy in palliative care. It is therefore unclear whether palliative care professionals have a role in addressing these issues with patients and their partners. AIM: To understand people's experiences of sexuality and intimacy when living with a terminal illness. DESIGN: A Heideggerian hermeneutic (interpretive) phenomenological study was undertaken. Data were collected using one-to-one conversational interviews. An iterative approach to analysing the narratives was used to reveal shared meanings. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 27 patients and 14 partners of patients with either cancer or motor neuron disease were recruited from outpatient, community and hospice inpatient units. All participants were aware that the illness was life-limiting. FINDINGS: When someone is living with a life-limiting illness, their coupled relationship is also dying. In their being-towards-death-of-the-couple, patients and partners of patients with motor neuron disease and terminal cancer experienced connecting and disconnecting within their coupled relationship. Becoming-apart-as-a-couple was experienced as loss of spontaneity, as lack of reciprocity and as rejection. This was influenced by a range of factors including medical treatments, disfigurement and the disabling effects of equipment. Some participants experienced re-connecting through becoming-closer-as-a-couple, although this was not always sustained. CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds new light on people's experiences of sexuality and intimacy when living with a terminal illness. The ethos of holistic care requires palliative care professionals to provide opportunities for patients and their partners to discuss any concerns they might have about their coupled relationship and to understand the meanings symptoms have for them.","10.1177/0269216313519489","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Neuron Disease; Neoplasms; Sexual Partners; Sexuality; Terminally Ill","Cancer; Heidegger; couple; motor neuron disease; palliative care; partner; phenomenology; sexuality; terminal illness; terminally ill","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

A series of 25 men (aged from 22 to 58 years) with a diagnosis of DM1 was analyzed. Muscular Impairment Rating Scale (MIRS) was used to assess severity of muscular involvement. Erectile function was assessed using the short form of the International Index of Erectile Function test (IIEF-5). Levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone were assessed. All patients completed the Serbian version of the SF-36 questionnaire as a measure of health-related QoL. ED was present in 18 (72%) of patients. Seven (28%) patients were euogonadic, 16 (64%) had compensated hypogonadism and 2 (8%) had primary hypogonadism. ED was somewhat more common in patients with hypogonadism (78% vs. 57%). Mental composite score of SF-36 was lower in patients with ED (p<0.05). Our results showed that 72% of men with DM1 had ED and hypogonadism.

Fourteen female ALS patients, 13 male ALS patients, 22 healthy male controls and 20 healthy female controls were recruited into a comprehensive neuroimaging study. Cortical thickness measurements and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were utilized to explore gender-specific anatomical vulnerability. DTI analysis across all study groups revealed higher fractional anisotropy in association with male gender in the brainstem, cerebellum, fornix, thalamus, anterior forceps and corticospinal tracts accounting for diagnosis and age. While females showed a trend of higher age-adjusted cortical thickness in the right parieto-occipital and left mid-frontal regions, males demonstrated higher cortical thickness in the left lingual and left superior temporal regions, accounting for diagnosis. Significant multifocal white matter differences have also been identified between healthy male and female controls. In conclusion, sexual dimorphism is an overlooked and potentially confounding factor in admixed ALS neuroimaging studies. Our results suggest that gender is an additional dimension of disease heterogeneity in ALS. Given the significant pre- and post-morbid gender differences, we feel that ALS imaging studies should be controlled for gender or, alternatively, single gender studies should be considered.","10.3109/21678421.2013.865749","Aged; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Characteristics","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; MRI; gender; neuroimaging; phenotypic heterogeneity","Journal Article"

Our goals were to determine the overall effect size of the association and to examine moderators of the relationship. METHODS: Literature searches identified 71 studies with a control or comparison group and examined the association of the syndromes with traumatic events including abuse of a psychological, emotional, sexual, or physical nature sustained during childhood or adulthood, combat exposure, or PTSD. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Planned subgroup analyses and meta-regression examined potential moderators. RESULTS: Individuals who reported exposure to trauma were 2.7 (95% confidence interval = 2.27-3.10) times more likely to have a functional somatic syndrome. This association was robust against both publication bias and the generally low quality of the literature. The magnitude of the association with PTSD was significantly larger than that with sexual or physical abuse. The association of reported trauma with chronic fatigue syndrome was larger than the association with either irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia. Studies using nonvalidated questionnaires or self-report of trauma reported larger associations than did those using validated questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that traumatic events are associated with an increased prevalence of functional somatic syndromes. The analyses also highlight limitations of the existing literature and emphasize the importance of prospective studies, examining the potential similarities and differences of these conditions, and pursuing hypothesis-driven studies of the mechanisms underlying the link between trauma, PTSD, and functional somatic syndromes.","10.1097/PSY.0000000000000010","Chronic Pain; Humans; Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Neuromuscular Diseases; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Temporomandibular Joint Disorders","PTSD, meta-analysis; functional somatic syndromes; trauma","Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Systematic Review"

Personal, occupational, and job-related characteristics were included as covariates. RESULTS: An average of 7.2% of workers reported experiencing at least one workplace injustice over the past 12 months. Female workers were significantly more likely to experience age and gender discrimination, and unwanted sexual attention than male workers. Both male and female workers who experienced any workplace injustice (i.e., discrimination, harassment, or violence) reported approximately two- to threefold increased risk for physical and mental health problems (i.e., backaches, muscular pain, stomach pain, overall fatigue, headaches, anxiety/depression, sleeping problems, and injury) and absenteeism due to accidents or due to health problems.

There are similarities between the clinical presentation of vulvodynia, penoscrotodynia, persistent genital arousal disorder and restless genital syndrome patients. The aetiology of persistent genital arousal disorder and restless genital syndrome, similar to vulvodynia, could be better explained in terms of neuro-vascular dysfunction, genital peripheral neuropathy and/or dysfunctional micro-vascular arterio-venous shunting. Erythromelalgia lends itself to explain some cases of restless genital syndrome, who have concurrent restless legs syndrome; and therefore draw parallels with the red scrotum syndrome.

The aim of this study was to optimize the PRP preparation method and compare the effects of PRP from different preparation methods in restoration of erectile function in a rat model. The in vivo experiments used Sprague-Dawley male rats (n = 24), which were randomly divided into four groups of equal numbers: group I underwent sham operation, while the remaining three groups underwent bilateral CN crush. Crush injury groups were treated at the time of injury with an application of general PRP, optimized PRP [with the largest amount of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB] or normal saline-only injection in the corpus cavernosum, respectively. Four weeks later, erectile function was assessed by CN electrosimulation, and penile tissue was collected for histology. Results demonstrated that in the PRP group prepared with the ACD-A anticoagulant, chitosan and incubated at -20°C for 15 days had the largest amount of PDGF-AB and showed a synergistic effect on release (p < 0.05). Functional outcome measurement and immunofluorescence staining for the dorsal nerve revealed that improvement after bilateral CN injury occurred in the optimized PRP group (p < 0.05). It was concluded that optimized PRP with a high level of growth factors was more stable, and its injection into the corpus cavernosum facilitated recovery of erectile function.

We assessed appearance concerns and self-consciousness, self-esteem, and loneliness among women with NF. METHODS: Women with NF1 (n = 79) and NF2 (n = 48) completed the Derriford Appearance Scale to assess appearance concerns and sexual/bodily and social self-consciousness, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and UCLA Loneliness Scale. Women's appearance concerns were coded to determine whether they were NF-related and whether psychosocial factors contributed to the concerns. RESULTS: A total of 85% of women reported appearance concerns, many of which were NF-related and attributed to psychosocial factors. Women with NF1 reported significantly more sexual/bodily self-consciousness but similar levels of social self-consciousness compared with women with NF2. Significantly higher sexual/bodily self-consciousness was found among married/cohabiting women regardless of NF group. Compared with general population norms and breast cancer survivors (BCS), women with NF1 reported significantly greater sexual/bodily and social self-consciousness. Women with NF2 reported less sexual/bodily self-consciousness compared with population norms, yet tended to report greater sexual/bodily self-consciousness than BCS. Women with NF2 reported significantly greater social self-consciousness compared with population norms and BCS. For both NF1 and NF2, higher levels of sexual/bodily and social self-consciousness were related to lower self-esteem and higher levels of social self-consciousness to more loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: Appearance concerns are prevalent, and social self-consciousness is high, among women with NF1 and NF2. Women with NF1 compared with NF2 experience more sexual/bodily self-consciousness.

This study was designed to compare the urogenital and anorectal functional outcome of TME with and without IONM of innervation to the bladder and the internal anal sphincter. METHODS: A consecutive series of 150 patients with primary rectal cancer were analysed. Fifteen match pairs with open TME and combined urogenital and anorectal functional assessment at follow up were established identical regarding gender, tumour site, tumour stage, neoadjuvant radiotherapy and type of surgery. Urogenital and anorectal function was evaluated prospectively on the basis of self-administered standardized questionnaires, measurement of residual urine volume and longterm-catheterization rate. RESULTS: Newly developed urinary dysfunction after surgery was reported by 1 of 15 patients in the IONM group and by 6 of 15 in the control group (p = 0.031). Postoperative residual urine volume was significantly higher in the control group. At follow up impaired anorectal function was present in 1 of 15 patients undergoing TME with IONM and in 6 of 15 without IONM (p = 0.031).

Since PM disorders lead to irritation/compression of the anatomic structures passing under its belly, the main clinical PS signs and symptoms are actually the clinical signs and symptoms of irritation/ compression of neural and vascular structures passing through the infrapiriform foramen: sciatic nerve/SN, inferior gluteal nerve, posterior femoral cutaneous nerve, pudendal nerve, inferior gluteal artery and vein and inferior pudendal artery and vein. The clinical picture is usually dominated by signs and symptoms of irritation/compression of SN (SN irritation --> low back and buttock pain, sciatica,paresthesias in distribution of SN; SN compression --> low back and buttock pain,sciatica, paresthesias and neurologic deficit in distribution of SN). Irritation/compression of other structures can result in the following signs and symptoms: inferior gluteal nerve --> atrophy of gluteal muscles; posterior femoral cutaneous nerve --> pain, paresthesias and sensory disturbances in the posterior thigh; pudendal nerve --> pudendal neuralgia, painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), sexual dysfunction, urination and defecation problems; inferior gluteal artery --> ischemic buttock pain; inferior pudendal artery --> ischemic pain in the area of external sex organs, perineum and rectum, sexual dysfunction, urination and defecation problems; inferior gluteal vein --> venous stasis in gluteal area; inferior pudendal vein --> venous stasis in external sex organs and rectum. Functional/non-organic and organic PM disorders can cause PS: spasm, shortening, hypertrophy, anatomic variations, edema, fibrosis, adhesions, hematoma, atrophy, cyst, bursitis, abscess, myositis ossificans, endometriosis, tumors (functional disorders: PM spasm and shortening). The most common causes for PS are PM spasm, shortening and hypertrophy and anatomic variations of PM and SN. In 5-6% of patients with low back pain and/or unilateral sciatica, the pain is caused by PM disorders. PS diagnosis can be made on the basis of anamnesis, clinical picture, clinical examination, EMNG, perisciatic anesthetic block of PM and radiological exams (pelvis/PM MRI; MR neurography of LS plexus and SN). PS therapy includes medicamentous therapy, physical therapy, kynesitherapy, acupuncture, therapeutic perisciatic blocks, botulinum toxin injections and surgical treatment (tenotomy of PM, neurolysis of SN).",NA,"Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Piriformis Muscle Syndrome; Sciatica","","English Abstract; Journal Article; Review"

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of patients referred to urogynecology practices: a private practice (COMM) and a tertiary university-based practice (UNIV). We identified within our population a subset of patients with LM and a reference group without LM. The primary outcome was to report the prevalence of LM within a urogynecology referral population. Our secondary outcomes include mean Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) scores, medication use, medical co-morbidities, and presence of vulvodynia. RESULTS: The prevalence of LM was 24% at the UNIV detected on 5,618 examinations and 9% at the COMM based on 946 examinations. Women with LM were significantly younger: mean age 56.8 years vs 65.5 (p < 0.001). There was no difference in mean parity (2.3), BMI (28.2 kg/m(2)), and race (94% white). Patients with LM reported significantly higher mean symptom bother scores (PFDI, PFIQ; p = <0. 001) related to prolapse, defecatory dysfunction, and urinary symptoms. Women with LM were more likely to report a diagnosis of fibromyalgia (OR 4.4 [1.7, 11.0]), depression (OR 1.8 [1.2, 2.7]), a history of sexual abuse (OR 2.4 [1.3, 4.7]), and use narcotic pain medications (OR 2.5 [1.2, 5.2]). CONCLUSIONS: Levator myalgia is a prevalent condition in urogynecology practice, and is associated with approximately 50% greater bother in urinary, defecatory, and prolapse symptoms.","10.1007/s00192-013-2089-8","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anus Diseases; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Myalgia; Pain; Pelvic Organ Prolapse; Prevalence; Urinary Incontinence","","Journal Article"

This study was designed to explore the mechanism of VED in penile rehabilitation by analyzing cavernous oxygen saturation (SO2) and to examine the effect of VED therapy on preventing penile shrinkage after BCNC. Thirty adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into three groups: group 1, sham surgery; group 2, BCNC; and group 3, BCNC+VED. Penile length and diameter were measured on a weekly basis. After 4 weeks of therapy, the penile blood was extracted by three methods for blood gas analysis (BGA): method 1, cavernous blood was aspirated at the flaccid state; method 2, cavernous blood was aspirated at the traction state; and method 3, cavernous blood was aspirated immediately after applying VED. SO2 values were tested by the blood gas analyzer. The results showed that VED therapy is effective in preventing penile shrinkage induced by BCNC (Penile shortening: BCNC group 1.9±1.1 mm; VED group 0.3±1.0 mm; P<0.01. Penile diameter reduction: BCNC group 0.28±0.14 mm; VED group 0.04±0.14 mm; P<0.01). The mean SO2±s.d. values were increased by VED application (88.25%±4.94%) compared to the flaccid (76.53%±4.16%) or traction groups (78.93%±2.56%) (P<0.05). The calculated blood constructs in the corpus cavernosum right after VED application were 62% arterial and 38% venous blood. These findings suggest that VED therapy can effectively preserve penile size in rats with BCNC injury. The beneficial effect of VED therapy is related to antihypoxia by increasing cavernous blood SO2.","10.1038/aja.2013.18","Animals; Blood Gas Analysis; Erectile Dysfunction; Hypoxia; Male; Organ Size; Oxygen; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Vacuum","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The aim of this study was to compare the potency recovery rate of patients with clinically localised prostate cancer treated by bilateral nerve-sparing (BNS) RARP or retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP), and secondarily, the urinary continence recovery evaluation and the oncological efficacy. All patients treated with BNS-RARP or BNS-RRP for clinically localised prostate cancer, performed by a single dedicated surgeon, between January 2004 and December 2008, were enrolled in this non-randomised prospective comparative study. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and erection hardness score (EHS), in the form of a questionnaire, were self-administered to each patient pre-operatively and after 12 months. The presence of surgical margins was considered as oncological outcome measure. Eighty-two patients underwent BNS-RARP while 48 underwent BNS-RRP. For BNS-RARP and BNS-RRP the median operative time was 221 and 103 min, respectively (P<0.001; df=128; t=721.43),and intra-operative blood loss was 280 and 565 ml, respectively (P<0.001; df=128; t=1742.44). At a mean follow-up period of 12.4±2.3 months, 12 patients (25%) in the BNS-RRP group and 22 (26.8%) in the BNS-RARP group were considered potent with or without drugs (P=0.81). Moreover, we did not find any statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of IEFF and EHS scores after treatment (17.21 vs. 16.98; P=0.16 and 2.1 vs. 2.0; P=0.54). On the other hand, statistically significant differences between the 2 groups were found in terms of faster urinary continence recovery and the presence of positive surgical margins (P<0.001, P=0.009). Shorter catheterization duration (7 vs. 3 days) and post-operative hospital stays (8 vs. 4 days; P<0.001) were found in the BNS-RARP group compared to the BNS-RRP group. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that BNS-RARP does not improve erectile function recovery compared to open radical prostatectomy; however, it significantly improves urinary continence and decreases the presence of positive surgical margins.","10.3892/or.2013.2365","Aged; Erectile Dysfunction; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Selection; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prospective Studies; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Recovery of Function; Robotics; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Bladder; Urinary Incontinence","","Comparative Study; Journal Article"
"23542853","Bilateral accessory breast tissue of the vulva: a case report introducing a novel labiaplasty technique.","Wagner IJ; Damitz LA; Carey E; Zolnoun D","Annals of plastic surgery","2013","INTRODUCTION: We present the case of a 23-year-old female with bilateral ectopic breast tissue of the vulva, the repair of which necessitated a novel labiaplasty technique. Labiaplasty is becoming an increasingly frequent cosmetic procedure, and the popularity of brief didactic labiaplasty courses has risen in response to consumer demand. There is a paucity of detailed anatomic description of female sensory innervation patterns to the clitoris and surrounding structures. This places patients at risk for denervation of clitoral structures during labiaplasty procedures. Our novel technique proposes a method of individualized patient neurosensory mapping preoperatively, which allows for surgical planning to avoid injury to the sensory branches of the dorsal clitoral nerve. METHODS: A 23-year-old female presented with bilateral vulvar masses that involved the clitoral complex, which had first become apparent during the second trimester of pregnancy, and failed to resolve in the postpartum period. We describe the preoperative planning and intraoperative approach and dissection to labiaplasty in this patient, which was complex given the size of the masses, and specifically designed to avoid injury to sensory branches of the dorsal clitoral nerve. DISCUSSION: As labiaplasty becomes more common, it is important to approach labiaplasty patients with a detailed understanding of the sensory innervation of the clitoris and surrounding structures, to avoid nerve injury and resultant sexual dysfunction. Traditional labiaplasty approaches may violate the sensory innervation patterns of the clitoral region, thus causing a sensory loss that affects patient sexual function. Our novel approach to preoperative clitoral nerve sensory mapping provides an alternative method of labiaplasty that may avoid denervation injury.","10.1097/SAP.0b013e31827ead39","Breast; Choristoma; Female; Humans; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Pudendal Nerve; Vulva; Vulvar Diseases; Young Adult","","Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

AIM: To describe the functioning on different domains of sexuality in a relatively large sample of women with CMT, provide comparisons between mildly and severely affected patients and between women with the two different types of CMT (demyelinating vs. axonal), and assess the relationship between sexual function and age of onset. METHODS: Fifty-seven women (age: 18-60 years) were approached in a CMT rehabilitation clinic by a psychologist and administered the Italian version of the McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire (MFSQ). Data from 40 patients who had had sexual intercourse in the previous 4 weeks were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measures are the factors MFSQ-SEX and MFSQ-PARTNER, which describe sexual functioning and sexual satisfaction with a partner, respectively. RESULTS: Almost 30% of women did not engage in sexual intercourse with a partner. Overall sexual problems were more prominent in younger women and tended to be lower as age increased: this pattern was different from what was reported in previous studies in comparable samples of healthy Italian women. Severity of CMT was associated with better sexual functioning in the areas of desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, with women with more severe symptoms reporting greater functioning. Women with more severe CMT symptoms reported more pain during intercourse. Age of CMT onset and type of CMT (demyelinating vs. axonal) were not associated with differences in sexual functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Findings point to the importance of including assessment of sexual dysfunction in young women with mild CMT symptoms and the importance of providing sex therapy or counseling to these patients.","10.1111/jsm.12126","Adolescent; Adult; Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease; Dyspareunia; Female; Humans; Italy; Middle Aged; Orgasm; Sex Factors; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Sexuality; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease; Female Sexuality; Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy","Journal Article"

METHODS: Sections of the cavernous nerves were excised bilaterally (5 mm), followed by immediate bilateral surgical repair. A total of 20 study nerves per group were reconstructed by interposition of empty silicon tubes and silicon tubes seeded with either glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor-overexpressing or green fluorescent protein-expressing Schwann cells. Control groups were either sham-operated or received bilateral nerve transection without nerve reconstruction. Erectile function was evaluated by relaparotomy, electrical nerve stimulation and intracavernous pressure recording after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks. The animals underwent re-exploration only once, and were killed afterwards. The nerve grafts were investigated for the maturation state of regenerating nerve fibers and the fascular composition. RESULTS: Recovery of erectile function took at least 4 weeks in the current model. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor-transduced Schwann cell grafts restored erectile function better than green fluorescent protein-transduced controls and unseeded conduits. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor-transduced grafts promoted an intact erectile response (4/4) at 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks that was overall significantly superior to negative controls (P < 0.001). Maximum intracavernous pressure on electrostimulation was significantly elevated using glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor-transduced grafts compared with negative controls (P = 0.018) and unseeded tubes (P = 0.034). Return of function was associated with the electron microscopic evidence of preganglionic myelinated nerve fibers and postganglionic unmyelinated axons.

In conclusion, with improving the screening methods of patients with primary and secondary myopathies, it has been seen an increase of cases in which a cardiac involvement occurred before or after the onset of the neuromuscular disorders. One of the most frequent alterations is represented by atrial fibrillation, responsible for an increased risk of cerebral embolism, with absolute indication for oral anticoagulation therapy. The myopathy more frequently associated with atrial fibrillation, is myotonic dystrophy, although the risk of cerebral embolism in these patients does not appear to be higher than the general population.

Although micturition, defecation and/or sexual function are by definition affected, little seems to be known about long-term outcome. Aim of this study is to review current literature on outcome of micturition, defecation and sexual function in CES due to lumbar disk herniation. METHODS: A literature search was done in Pubmed, Embase and Web of Science using a sensitive search string combination. Studies were selected by predefined selection criteria and risk of bias was assessed using a Cochrane checklist adjusted for this purpose. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included. Risk of bias varied with six studies showing low risk. Mean minimal follow-up time was 17.0 months (range 3-24 months). All studies evaluated micturition and reported dysfunction at follow-up in 42.5% (range 13.3-90.0%). Defecation and sexual function were evaluated in eight and nine studies, respectively, and reported to be 49.6 (range 10.5-90.0%) and 44.3% (range 10.0-76.6%), respectively. Only two studies assessed sexual function in all patients at follow-up. CONCLUSION: This review offers an insight into the extent of micturition dysfunction, defecation dysfunction and sexual dysfunction (SD) in CES after decompression. Our findings show that dysfunction is extremely common, even at long-term follow-up. A condition as invalidating as CES requires proper patient information and the outcomes presented here may help in providing those data. Bias in included studies, lack of universal definitions and incomplete follow-up results qualify these data as the best we momentarily have, but still subject to improvement. Since SD seems to be severely underreported, we recommend further research to explore the extent of this problem, as well as the use of questionnaires in future clinical (prospective) studies to accomplish a more patient-based approach.","10.1007/s00586-012-2601-8","Defecation; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Lumbar Vertebrae; Polyradiculopathy; Rectal Diseases; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Urination; Urination Disorders","","Journal Article; Systematic Review"
"23237228","Sonic Hedgehog regulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor in normal and regenerating cavernous nerves.","Bond CW; Angeloni N; Harrington D; Stupp S; Podlasek CA","The journal of sexual medicine","2013","INTRODUCTION: The cavernous nerve (CN) is commonly injured during prostatectomy. Manipulation of the nerve microenvironment is critical to improve regeneration and develop novel erectile dysfunction therapies. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) treatment promotes CN regeneration. The mechanism of how this occurs is unknown. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) facilitates return of erectile function after CN injury and it has been suggested in cortical neurons and the sciatic nerve that BDNF may be a target of SHH. AIM: To determine if SHH promotes CN regeneration through a BDNF-dependent mechanism. METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats underwent (i) bilateral CN crush (N = 15); (ii) SHH treatment of pelvic ganglia (PG)/CN (N = 10); (iii) SHH inhibition in PG/CN (N = 14 rats); (iv) CN crush with SHH treatment of PG/CN (N = 10 rats); (v) CN crush with SHH treatment and BDNF inhibition (N = 14 rats); and (vi) CN injury and SHH treatment of the penis (N = 23). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BDNF and glial fibrillary acidic protein were quantified in PG/CN by Western, and a t-test was used to determine differences. RESULTS: In normal rats SHH inhibition in the PG/CN decreased BDNF 34% and SHH treatment increased BDNF 36%. BDNF was increased 44% in response to SHH treatment of crushed CNs, and inhibition of BDNF in crushed CNs treated with SHH protein hampers regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: SHH regulates BDNF in the normal and regenerating PG/CN. BDNF is part of the mechanism of how SHH promotes regeneration, thus providing an opportunity to further manipulate the nerve microenvironment with combination therapy to enhance regeneration.","10.1111/jsm.12030","Animals; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Carbazoles; Enzyme Inhibitors; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Hedgehog Proteins; Immunohistochemistry; Indole Alkaloids; Male; Nerve Regeneration; Neuroprotective Agents; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Peripheral Nerves; Rats","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

A clear genetic link to point mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene has been shown in a small group of familial ALS patients. The exact etiology of ALS is still uncertain, but males have consistently been shown to be at a higher risk for the disease than females. Here we present male-specific effects of the mutant SOD1 transgene on proliferation, neurogenesis, and sensitivity to oxidative stress in rat neural progenitor cells (rNPCs). E14 pups were bred using SOD1(G93A) transgenic male rats and wild-type female rats. The spinal cord and cortex tissues were collected, genotyped by PCR using primers for the SOD1(G93A) transgene or the male-specific Sry gene, and cultured as neurospheres. The number of dividing cells was higher in male rNPCs compared to female rNPCs. However, SOD1(G93A) over-expression significantly reduced cell proliferation in male cells but not female cells. Similarly, male rNPCs produced more neurons compared to female rNPCs, but SOD1(G93A) over-expression significantly reduced the number of neurons produced in male cells. Finally we asked whether sex and SOD1(G93A) transgenes affected sensitivity to oxidative stress. There was no sex-based difference in cell viability after treatment with hydrogen peroxide or 3-morpholinosydnonimine, a free radical-generating agent. However, increased cytotoxicity by SOD1(G93A) over-expression occurred, especially in male rNPCs. These results provide essential information on how the mutant SOD1 gene and sexual dimorphism are involved in ALS disease progression.","10.1371/journal.pone.0048581","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Animals; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Male; Mutant Proteins; Neural Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Oxidative Stress; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sex Characteristics; Superoxide Dismutase; Superoxide Dismutase-1; Transgenes","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats that had undergone bilateral CN injury were treated by ICI with or without PPI of hBMSCs (10 rats per group). hBMSCs were harvested from healthy human donors. Fibrin scaffolds were used for PPI of hBMSCs. After 4 weeks, erectile responses to electric pelvic ganglion stimulation were studied. The expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-positive nerve fibers and smooth muscle/collagen ratio was evaluated in each penis. RESULTS: ICI of hBMSCs slightly improved erectile function compared with the control group (maximal intracavernosal pressure/mean arterial pressure, 39.1% vs 21.7%; P=.060), but a combination of PPI and ICI significantly improved erectile function (45.0%, P=.007). After stem cell therapy, the number of nNOS-positive nerve fibers increased significantly in the PPI+ICI group (P=.017). The smooth muscle/collagen ratio increased significantly after stem cell therapy in the ICI and PPI+ICI groups (both P<.001). CONCLUSION: ICI of hBMSCs in a rat model of CN injury results in recovery of penile erection by decreasing corporeal smooth muscle deterioration and collagen deposition.

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate erectile responses to the sGC stimulator BAY 41-8543 in physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. METHODS: Increases in intracavernosal pressure (ICP) in response to intracavernosal (ic) injections of BAY 41-8543 were investigated in the anesthetized rat. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Increases in ICP/MAP in response to ic injections of BAY 41-8543 and the interaction of BAY 41-8543 with exogenous and endogenously released NO were investigated and the effect of the sGC stimulator on cavernosal nerve injury was assessed. The mechanism of the increase in ICP/MAP in response to ic injection of acetylcholine was investigated. RESULTS: The ic injections of BAY 41-8543 increased ICP/MAP and the duration of the response. BAY 41-8543 was less potent than sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and ic injections of BAY 41-8543 and SNP produced a larger response than the algebraic sum of responses to either agent alone. Simultaneous ic injection of BAY 41-8543 and cavernosal nerve stimulation produced a greater response than either intervention alone. Atropine and cavernosal nerve crush injury decreased the response to nerve stimulation and ic injection of BAY 41-8543 restored the response. CONCLUSION: These data show that BAY 41-8543 has significant erectile activity and can synergize with exogenous and endogenously released NO. This study shows that atropine and nerve crush attenuate the response to cavernosal nerve stimulation and that BAY 41-8543 can restore the response. The results with atropine, L-NAME and hexamethonium indicate that the response to ic injection of acetylcholine is mediated by muscarinic receptors and the release of NO with no significant role for nicotinic receptors. These results suggest that BAY 41-8543 would be useful in the treatment of ED.","10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02912.x","Acetylcholine; Animals; Atropine; Blood Pressure; Cholinergic Agonists; Electric Stimulation; Enzyme Inhibitors; Heart Rate; Hexamethonium; Injections; Male; Morpholines; NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Nicotinic Antagonists; Nitric Oxide Donors; Nitroprusside; Parasympatholytics; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Pyrimidines; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"
"22974190","A systematic review of the utility of antidepressant pharmacotherapy in the treatment of vulvodynia pain.","Leo RJ; Dewani S","The journal of sexual medicine","2013","INTRODUCTION:   Antidepressants have often been recommended as a potential treatment for the management of vulvodynia. However, review of the evidence supporting this recommendation has not been systematically assessed. AIM:   To evaluate the efficacy of antidepressant pharmacotherapy in the treatment of vulvodynia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   An assessment of the methodological quality of published reports addressing the utility of antidepressants in the treatment of vulvodynia was undertaken. Several secondary outcomes generated in the existing literature were also examined. METHODS:   A comprehensive search of the available literature was conducted. RESULTS:   The search yielded 13 published reports, i.e., 2 randomized controlled trials, 1 quasi-experimental trial, 7 non-experimental studies, and 3 case reports. A number of methodological shortcomings were identified in several of the reports with respect to study design including lack of clear inclusion/exclusion criteria, small sample sizes, lack of comparison groups, insufficient blinding, among others. The vast majority of studies utilized tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Evidence supporting the benefits of TCAs studied to date was limited, i.e., based largely upon descriptive reports but unsubstantiated by randomized controlled trials. There were no systematic investigations into the comparative efficacy of different antidepressant classes in the treatment of vulvodynia. CONCLUSION:   There is insufficient evidence to support the recommendation of antidepressant pharmacotherapy in the treatment of vulvodynia. Although some vulvodynia-afflicted patients derive symptom relief from antidepressants, additional research is required to identify those characteristics that would predict those patients for whom antidepressants are more likely to be effective.","10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02915.x","Analgesics; Antidepressive Agents; Complex Regional Pain Syndromes; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pain Management; Treatment Outcome; Vulvodynia","Antidepressants; Pharmacotherapy; Sexual Pain Disorder; Treatment; Vestibulodynia; Vulvodynia","Journal Article; Systematic Review"

The lack of conclusive data concerning these symptoms prompted us to assess the psychological aspects of ALS patients in advanced stages of the disease. Moreover, we evaluated the personality of their caregivers in order to analyse the relationship between the pair. For these purposes, we studied 10 patients with ALS in late stages (tracheostomized for 36 months) and their caregivers using a questionnaire specifically elaborated for patients' communication limits. To assess the state of anxiety and depression of both patients and caregivers, we used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). To investigate caregivers' personality, we administered the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ). Data showed a trend of aggression and high level of obsessiveness in ALS patients, associated with several clinical characteristics. High levels of anxiety emerged in both patients and caregivers. Regarding BFQ, caregivers obtained higher scores in the dimension of Conscientiousness and very low scores in Extraversion and Emotional Stability. In conclusion, the study showed a potential and considerable effect of the long duration of ALS on patients' personality and caregivers' distress.","10.3109/17482968.2012.696658","Aged; Aggression; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Anxiety; Caregivers; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Sexuality; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Part A","2013","Postprostatectomy erectile dysfunction (ED) is the major problem for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Recently, gene and stem cell-based therapy of the corpus cavernosum has been attempted for postprostatectomy ED, but those therapies are limited by rapid blood flow and disruption of the normal architecture of the corpus cavernosum. In this study, we attempted to regenerate the damaged cavernous nerve (CN), which is the main cause of ED. We investigated the effectiveness of human adipose-derived stem cell (hADSC) and nerve growth factor-incorporated hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel (NGF-hydrogel) application on the CN in a rat model of bilateral cavernous nerve crush injury. Four weeks after the operation, erectile function was assessed by detecting the intracavernous pressure (ICP)/arterial pressure level by CN electrostimulation. The ICP was significantly increased by application of hADSC with NGF-hydrogel compared to the other experimental groups. CN and penile tissue were collected for histological examination. PKH-26 labeled hADSC colocalized with beta III tubulin were shown in CN tissue sections. hADSC/NGF-hydrogel treatment prevented smooth muscle atrophy in the corpus cavernosum. In addition, the hADSC/NGF-hydrogel group showed increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein expression. This study suggests that application of hADSCs with NGF-hydrogel on the CN might be a promising treatment for postprostatectomy ED.","10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0654","Adipocytes; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Combined Modality Therapy; Drug Carriers; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Hydrogels; Male; Nerve Growth Factor; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prostatectomy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Recovery of Function; Stem Cell Transplantation; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

METHODS: Bilateral CN dissection (BCND) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats. After BCND 10 rats each were treated with PPI and/or ICI of ADSCs. After 4 weeks erectile responses to electric pelvic ganglion stimulation were studied. Each penis was evaluated in terms of the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and smooth muscle content. RESULTS: The ratio of maximal intracavernosal pressure to mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased in the BCND group (24.5%) compared to the sham group (64.2%). PPI and ICI significantly improved erectile function (46.7% and 47.9%, respectively) compared to the BCND group. A combination of PPI and ICI (42.5%) did not afford any incremental effect on erectile function. After stem cell therapy, the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase increased slightly in the ICI group without statistical relevance, whereas the PPI and combination groups showed marginally significant increases (P = 0.08). In both the PPI and ICI groups, the smooth muscle content was similar to the sham group. The combination group showed remarkable increase in smooth muscle content to an extent greater than that seen when either treatment was given alone, although statistically not significant. CONCLUSION: PPI or ICI of ADSCs in a rat model of CN injury were equally effective in recovering penile erection, but may address different types of pathophysiology.","10.1002/pros.22567","Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Electric Stimulation; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Models, Animal; Muscle, Smooth; Nerve Regeneration; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prostate; Prostheses and Implants; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Recovery of Function; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stem Cells","","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

METHOD: Candidates for LTME were included in this study. PAN preservation status after LTME was examined in detail by video review. Patients completed a functional questionnaire (the International Index of Erectile Function) before and 3, 6 and 12 months after the operation. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients who underwent LTME were assessable. Detailed video reviews identified inadvertent PAN damage during surgery. PAN injury was observed in 11 cases (41%), including eight cases (32%) of inadvertent PAN damage (incomplete preservation group). There was a trend toward increasing inadvertent PAN injury rate in patients with high body mass index and large tumours. The results from all patients who underwent LTME showed no deterioration in total International Index of Erectile Function or its domain scores 12 months after surgery. In the incomplete preservation group, these scores temporarily decreased (3 and 6 months after surgery), but such deterioration was not observed in the complete preservation group. Most of the 12 patients with potentially active erectile function before the operation recovered this function, and only one patient (7%) with PAN injury was still judged as inactive 12 months after surgery.

We studied women with FAP in three stages of the disease: asymptomatic women (n=12), women in the early stage of the disease (n=8) and 3 women in the most progressive stage of the disease. We hypothesize that women with FAP suffer from pelvic floor hypotonicity, which may hinder orgasmic function and as such, lead to deteriorated sexual function. METHODS: Twenty-three women with FAP were studied. Clinical examinations were performed using the following scales: Clinical Evaluation Scale (CES), Visual Analog Scale of Quality of Life (VAS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Pelvic Floor Manometry (PFM). RESULTS: Of the women, 5 (21.7%) had a score of < 26 on the FSFI, suggesting sexual dysfunction, 3 of which had FAP at the most progressive stage. None of the asymptomatic women had low FSFI scores. The manometrical rates (PFM) of tonus and strength of the pelvic floor showed significant differences between groups. CONCLUSION: Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) may occur in the initial stages of the disease but is more prevalent in women in the advanced stages of the disease. There is an increasing incidence of FSD as FAP disease progresses, namely in terms of HSDD and orgasmic sensation. In the asymptomatic group, the females revealed PFM alterations without stress urinary incontinence, which is regarded to be a discrete deterioration of pelvic floor muscle function.",NA,"Adult; Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial; Asymptomatic Diseases; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Muscle Hypotonia; Pelvic Floor; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Urination Disorders","","Journal Article"

Sacral (Tarlov) cysts, which form on dorsal (sensory) roots, most commonly of S2 and S3 in the sacral spine, are reported to produce genital symptoms that bear similarities to those described for PGAD. AIMS: The present study ascertained the incidence of Tarlov cysts in the sacral spine of women with PGAD symptoms. METHODS: Women in a PGAD internet support group were asked to submit MRIs of their sacral region to the investigators, who evaluated the MRIs for the presence or absence of Tarlov cysts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence or absence of Tarlov cysts at the level of the sacral spine. RESULTS: Tarlov cysts were present in 12 of the first 18 (66.7%) MRIs submitted to the investigators by women who suffer from PGAD symptoms. By contrast to this incidence, that of Tarlov cysts reported in the literature for large samples of the population observed for various disorders (e.g., lumbosacral pain) is 1.2-9.0%. CONCLUSION: Tarlov cysts have been described in the literature as producing paresthesias and genital sensory disturbances. Hence, at least some cases of PGAD might be considered to be a Tarlov cyst-induced paresthesia. Based on the relatively high occurrence of Tarlov cysts currently observed in women who suffer from PGAD symptoms, it would seem advisable to suspect Tarlov cysts as a possible organic etiological factor underlying PGAD.","10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02765.x","Adult; Arousal; Female; Humans; Internet; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Prevalence; Sacrum; Self-Help Groups; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Tarlov Cysts; United States; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

Between May 2009 and December 2009, 367 patients who consecutively underwent RARP by a single surgeon were divided into two groups, one that had single prostate biopsy and another multiple biopsies before RARP. The groups were matched for significant clinicopathologic preoperative variables, and only premorbidly potent low-risk cases that underwent nerve sparing were included. This left 50 and 23 patients for analysis in the single and multiple biopsy groups, respectively. The primary endpoint was potency and continence at 3 and 6 months after surgery. We found continence rates of 84% (83%) and 94% (96%) for single (multiple) biopsy groups at 3 and 6 months, respectively (P=0.88, P=0.77). Multiple biopsy patients had worse postoperative erectile function at 6 months (57% versus 80%, P=0.03). Men subject to multiple preoperative biopsies are more likely to become impotent postoperatively than those who undergo surgery after a single biopsy. This should be borne in mind when counseling men regarding repeat biopsy as part of an active surveillance strategy.","10.1038/ijir.2012.9","Aged; Biopsy; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Preoperative Period; Prostate; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Robotics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Incontinence","","Journal Article"

However, its effectiveness remains poorly understood with some studies suggesting that BF offers no advantage over the isolated pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). The main objective of this study was to systematically review available randomized controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of BF in female pelvic floor dysfunction treatment. Trials were electronically searched and rated for quality by use of the PEDro scale (values of 0-10). Randomized controlled trials assessing the training of pelvic floor muscle (PFM) using BF in women with PFM dysfunction were selected. Outcomes were converted to a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Trials were pooled with software used to prepare and update Cochrane reviews. Results are presented as weighted mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Twenty-two trials with 1,469 patients that analyzed BF in the treatment of urinary, anorectal, and/or sexual dysfunctions were included. PFMT alone led to a superior but not significant difference in the function of PFM when compared to PFMT with BF, by using vaginal measurement in the short and intermediate term: 9.89 (95 % CI -5.05 to 24.83) and 15.03 (95 % CI -9.71 to 39.78), respectively. We found a few and nonhomogeneous studies addressing anorectal and sexual function, which do not provide the cure rate calculations. Limitations of this review are the low quality and heterogeneity of the studies, involving the usage of distinct protocols of interventions, and various and different outcome measures. The results of this systematic review suggest that PFMT with BF is not more effective than other conservative treatments for female PFM dysfunction.","10.1007/s00192-012-1707-1","Biofeedback, Psychology; Female; Humans; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Diseases; Pelvic Floor; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Urinary Bladder, Overactive; Urinary Incontinence","","Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Systematic Review"

Additionally, while learning curve studies often define volume thresholds for improvement, few of these studies demonstrate specific technical modifications that allow reproducibility of improved outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate and quantify the learning curve for improving sexual function outcomes based on technical refinements that reduce neurovascular bundle displacement during nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a retrospective study of 400 consecutive RARPs, categorized into groups of 50, performed after elimination of continuous surgeon/assistant neurovascular bundle countertraction. SURGICAL PROCEDURE: Our approach to RARP has been described previously. A single-console robotic system was used for all cases. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite sexual function was measured within 1 yr of RARP. Linear regression was performed to determine factors influencing the recovery of sexual function. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Greater surgeon experience was associated with better 5-mo sexual function (p = 0.007) and a trend for better 12-mo sexual function (p = 0.061), with improvement plateauing after 250-300 cases. Additionally, younger patient age (both p<0.02) and better preoperative sexual function (<0.001) were associated with better 5- and 12-mo sexual function. Moreover, trainee robotic console time during nerve sparing was associated with worse 12-mo sexual function (p=0.021), while unilateral nerve sparing/non-nerve sparing was associated with worse 5-mo sexual function (p = 0.009). Limitations include the retrospective single-surgeon design. CONCLUSIONS: With greater surgeon experience, attenuating lateral displacement of the neurovascular bundle and resultant neurapraxia improve postoperative sexual function. However, to maximize outcomes, appropriate patient selection must be exercised when allowing trainee nerve-sparing involvement.","10.1016/j.eururo.2012.02.053","Aged; Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Graduate; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Learning Curve; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Penile Erection; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prostatectomy; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Robotics; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Video-Audio Media"

Centres participating in this EULAR Scleroderma Trial and Research substudy were asked to recruit patients consecutively. RESULTS: Of the 130 men studied, only 23 (17.7%) had a normal International Index of Erectile Function-5 score. Thirty-eight per cent of all participants had severe ED (International Index of Erectile Function-5 score ≤ 7). Men with ED were significantly older than subjects without ED (54.8 years vs. 43.3 years, P < 0.001) and more frequently had simultaneous non-SSc-related risk factors such as alcohol consumption. In 82% of SSc patients, the onset of ED was after the manifestation of the first non-Raynaud's symptom (median delay 4.1 years). ED was associated with severe cutaneous, muscular or renal involvement of SSc, elevated pulmonary pressures and restrictive lung disease. ED was treated in only 27.8% of men. The most common treatment was sildenafil, whose efficacy is not established in ED of SSc patients. CONCLUSIONS: Severe ED is a common and early problem in men with SSc.

"22341949","[Treatment of familial amyloid polyneuropathy].","Adams D; Samuel D; Slama M","Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)","2012","The treatment of familial amyloid polyneuropathies (FAP) is complex and requires a neurological and cardiological multidisciplinary coverage. It includes specific treatments to control the progression of the systemic amyloidogenesis, the symptomatic treatment of the peripheral and autonomic neuropathy (digestive, urinary, sexual, postural hypotension) and the treatment of organs severely involved by amyloidosis (heart, eyes, kidneys). First line specific treatment of met30 TTR-FAP is liver transplantation (LT) which allows to suppress the main source of mutant TTR, to stop the progression of the neuropathy in 70 % of cases at long-term (with an experience of 18 years) and to double the median survival. In case of severe renal or cardiac insufficiency, a double transplant kidney-liver or heart-liver can be discussed. The tafamidis (in temporary authorization of use in France) is a stabilizing medicine of the tetrameric TTR which showed in very early stages of met30 TTR-FAP short-term capacities to stop the progress of the peripheral neuropathy in 60 % of the cases versus 38 % with placebo. It should be proposed in case of contraindication of TH (age>70 years [20 % of the cases]), of very early stages (very low NIS-LL score), or for the period of wait of LT. Other innovative medicines issued from biopharmaceutical companies have been developed to block the hepatic production of both mutant and wild TTR which are noxious in the late forms NAH (>50 years old) (RNAi [RNA interference] therapeutics, AntiSens oligonucleotids), for removing the amyloid deposits (monoclonal antibody anti-SAP), or to slow down the formation of deposits of TTR and amyloidosis (combination of doxycycline-TUDCA). Clinical trials should be first addressed to the patients with a late onset of FAP or non-met30 TTR-FAP who are less responding to LT and patients with contraindications in the LT. Initial cardiac assessment and periodic cardiac investigations are important for the FAP according to the frequency of cardiac impairment which is responsible of high rate of mortality. Conduction disorders (atrio-ventricular blocks) require the implantation of a pacemaker in about one third of the cases during the evolution of the disease. A myocardial infiltration is detected in two third of the cases and is for a long time latent; it remains often limited to a diastolic dysfunction which can be responsible for hemodynamical difficulties during the LT; it evolves sometimes, late, towards a systolic dysfunction of bad prognosis. A combined liver-heart transplantation is proposed in cases of severe cardiac involvement which are contraindication to the LT only, essentially in forms ""not met30"". In every case of FAP, a regular cardiological follow-up is required for life, because of the progress of the cardiac involvement, which is not always stopped by the liver transplantation. The symptomatic treatments are indispensable to improve the quality of life of the patients: neurogenic pains, urinary disorders, liqueurs, sexual impotence, postural hypotension. The familial screening of the carriers of the TTR gene mutation and their regular follow-up by appropriate clinical examination and complementary investigations are major to detect early the onset of the disease to start as soon as possible specific therapy.","10.1016/j.lpm.2011.11.027","Amyloid; Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Benzoxazoles; Early Diagnosis; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Transplantation; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Liver Transplantation; Mutation; Prealbumin; Quality of Life; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering","","English Abstract; Journal Article"

We review the current literature evaluating the existing imaging modalities to image the neurovascular bundle around the prostate pre, intra, and postoperatively, thereby enabling development of surgical techniques for better preservation of nerve function. RECENT FINDINGS: Imaging modalities like multiphoton microscopy, optical coherence tomography, Coherent anti-Raman spectroscopy, exogenous fluoroscopy using prostate-specific membrane antigen, and so on have led to a better appreciation of the neurovascular bundle, thus encouraging novel techniques in nerve preservation during radical prostatectomy. SUMMARY: In an age of heightened patient expectations and increasing life expectancy, better visualization of the neurovascular bundle around the prostate using novel imaging modalities may provide breakthroughs in improving potency outcomes after radical prostatectomy.","10.1097/MOU.0b013e3283501826","Diagnostic Imaging; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prostate; Prostatectomy; Treatment Outcome; Vascular System Injuries","","Journal Article; Review"

Postoperative pain related to sling placement can occur and poses both diagnostic and treatment dilemmas. CASE: Four years after transobturator midurethral sling placement, the patient presented with complaints of left labial pain and dyspareunia since surgery. Using sensory mapping and a nerve stimulator, the problem was identified in the distribution of the genitofemoral nerve. Conservative therapy with a centrally acting neuromodulatory drug and nerve block relieved the pain. CONCLUSION: Postsling neuralgia diagnosis using sensory mapping and a nerve stimulator aids in indentifying the nerve involved and in successful conservative treatment with a nerve block.","10.1097/AOG.0b013e31822c96cb","Amides; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Anesthetics, Local; Autonomic Nerve Block; Carbamazepine; Female; Humans; Lidocaine; Lower Extremity; Middle Aged; Neuralgia; Postoperative Pain; Perineum; Ropivacaine; Suburethral Slings; Vulva","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

The mechanisms behind the development of post-RP ED are increasingly recognized and include cavernosal fibrosis and cavernosal smooth muscle apoptosis, resulting from cavernous nerve degeneration due to neuropraxia. In recent years, cell-based therapies have received increasing attention regarding their potential for recovery of erectile function following cavernous nerve injury (CNI). Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) are an attractive cell source for this application based on their regenerative potential and their clinical applicability. AIM: To review available evidence on the efficacy and mechanisms of action of MSC application for the treatment of ED, with an emphasis on ED following CNI. METHODS: A nonsystematic review was conducted on the available English literature between 1966 and 2011 on the search engines SciVerse-sciencedirect, SciVerse-scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed. RESULTS: MSCs from both bone marrow and adipose tissue have shown beneficial effects in a variety of animal models for ED. While MSC application in chronic disease models such as diabetes, aging, and hyperlipidemia may result in cell engraftment and possibly MSC differentiation, this observation has not been made in the acute CNI rat model. In the latter setting, MSC effects seem to be established by cell recruitment toward the major pelvic ganglion and local paracrine interaction with the host neural tissue. CONCLUSIONS: While the type of model may influence the mechanisms of action of this MSC-based therapy, MSCs generally display efficacy in various animal models for ED. Before translation to the clinic is established, various hurdles need to be overcome.","10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02556.x","Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Multipotent Stem Cells; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Postoperative Complications; Prostatectomy; Stromal Cells","","Journal Article; Review"

A literature review was performed to identify articles that reported surgical and nonsurgical management of TCs over the last 10 years. Tarlov cysts are often incidental lesions found in the spine and do not require surgical intervention in the great majority of cases. When TCs are symptomatic, the typical clinical presentation includes back pain, coccyx pain, low radicular pain, bowel/bladder dysfunction, leg weakness, and sexual dysfunction. Tarlov cysts may be revealed by MR and CT imaging of the lumbosacral spine and must be meticulously differentiated from other overlapping spinal pathological entities. They are typically benign, asymptomatic lesions that can simply be monitored. To date, no consensus exists about the best surgical strategy to use when indicated. The authors report and discuss various surgical strategies including posterior decompression, cyst wall resection, CT-guided needle aspiration with intralesional fibrin injection, and shunting. In operative patients, the rates of short-term and long-term improvement in clinical symptoms are not clear. Although neurological deficit frequently improves after surgical treatment of TC, pain is less likely to do so.","10.3171/2011.9.FOCUS11221","Humans; Microsurgery; Nervous System Diseases; Sacrum; Tarlov Cysts","","Journal Article; Review"

Injuries to uterine nerves (denervation) result in loss of fundocervical polarity, uterotubal dysmotility and retrograde menstruation. Ectopic endometrium, delivered by retrograde menstruation, adheres to injuries to uterosacral ligaments and peritoneal surfaces. Difficult vaginal deliveries result in laparoscopic appearances of asymmetry of uterosacral ligaments with, or without, ectopic endometrium. Straining during defaecation causes the ""classic"" appearances of nulliparous endometriosis including hypertrophy of the uterosacral ligaments often with large volumes of ectopic endometrium. Laparoscopic appearances depend on the site, nature, extent, and timing of tissue injury, as well as the presence of available endometrium.

We hypothesize that non-neuronal cause, such as vascular insults due to intraoperative tissue handling, may also have a minor but definite role in penile ischemia and consequent postoperative sexual dysfunction. Between May 2008 and July 2008, 64 patients were enrolled in the study (group 1). Following sterilization, the Odissey Tissue Oximeter probe was placed on the shaft of the penis, 2 cm from its base. The patient underwent continuous penile tissue saturation monitoring. Surgical dissection was altered whenever the oxygen saturation alarm went off until it was restored to 85%. In addition, 192 patients, matched for age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, baseline sexual function, Charlson comorbidity index and nerve-sparing status operated between October 2007 and July 2008, formed the control group (group 2). These patients did not have any intraoperative tissue oxygenation monitoring. Opening of the endopelvic fascia and steps of nerve sparing were associated with significant drops in oxygen levels, especially if done using torque. Drop in oxygen levels were also noted whenever excessive traction was applied on the Foley catheter, seminal vesicles or prostate during apical dissection. We deliberately modified our surgical steps to make surgery more traction free. A significantly higher percentage of group 1 patients with bilateral nerve sparing had no ED compared with group 2 patients at 6 weeks (24.5% vs 10.4%; P=0.014) and 52 weeks (83.7% vs 68%; P=0.029). Overall, 93.9% of patients in study group had Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score of 17 (mild to no ED) at 1 year compared with 78.4% of patients in the control group.

AIMS: To evaluate the different types of clinical syndrome of NS in a tertiary care hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a study of clinical profile of 16 patients with NS, seen in between August 2008 and December 2010. RESULTS: There were 13 male and 3 female patients in the age group of 23-48 years. The clinical syndromes included: Neuropsychiatric syndromes (10), myelopathy (5), and posterior circulation stroke (1). Neuropsychiatric symptoms were dementia, behavioral abnormalities, chronic psychosis, and myelopathy syndromes included acute transverse myelitis (ATM), chronic myelopathy, and syphilitic amyotrophy. Thirteen patients had positive venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL) and/or high Treponema pallidum hemagglutination titer in blood. Cerebrospinal fluid was positive for VDRL in 14 patients, raised protein was seen in 13 patients and lymphocytic pleocytosis was seen in 10 patients. Human immunodeficiency virus serology was negative in all the patients. Fourteen patients fulfilled the criteria of definitive NS and two of presumptive NS. All the patients except one received injection Procaine penicillin for 14 days. The patient with myelitis received a course of steroid, and one patient with associated hypothyroidism received thyroid supplement in addition to penicillin. On follow-up, dementia of short duration and ischemic stroke improved significantly and clinical status remained the same for ATM; others with mild symptoms improved with residual deficit. CONCLUSION: Syphilis can affect any part of the neuraxis. A high index of clinical suspicion is required to diagnose NS and institute the treatment early, particularly in patients with promiscuous sexual behavior.","10.4103/0028-3886.82719","Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Brain; Cardiolipins; Cholesterol; Female; Humans; India; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Motor Neuron Disease; Myelitis; Neurosyphilis; Penicillin G Procaine; Phosphatidylcholines; Prospective Studies; Risk-Taking; Spinal Cord; Substance-Related Disorders; Treponema pallidum; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

The purpose of this study was to examine the physical and psychosocial effects of breast cancer experienced by rural survivors at the time of treatment and currently and to examine differences in these effects between younger and older rural survivors based on menopausal status at diagnosis. METHODS: Women treated for breast cancer within the past 6 years at one of three rural cancer centers were mailed a survey with a cover letter from their oncology provider. RESULTS: Survey respondents (n=918, 83% response rate) were 67±13 years old, on average 3.2 years from treatment, 22% were premenopausal at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, and 95% were postmenopausal at the time of the survey. Women who were premenopausal at diagnosis were significantly more likely to experience numerous symptoms at the time of treatment and currently, including higher rates of hot flashes, vaginal dryness, loss of sexual desire, and weight gain (p≤0.001). The most common psychosocial concerns were fear of recurrence and change in body image, and women premenopausal at diagnosis were significantly more likely than postmenopausal women to report experiencing these concerns (68% vs. 47%, and 43% vs. 27%, respectively, p≤0.001).

Patients underwent a detailed clinical evaluation followed by laboratory investigation and neuroimaging studies and were followed up for 9 months to asses outcome and complications. RESULTS: 98 patients with non-traumatic paraplegia consisting of 71 males and 27 females (M:F: 5:2) were seen. The age range of the patients was between 16 and 76 years, with a mean age of 40 years (SD = 15.3) years; 54 (55%) of the patients presented after 2 months of the onset of paraplegia. The commonest symptoms were weakness of the lower limbs (100%), loss of sensation (55%), sphincteric disturbance (50%) radicular pain and paresthesia (38.4%), back pain (21.4%) and erectile dysfunction (40%). All the patients had X-ray of the spine; 26.3% had Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) spine. The commonest etiological factors were tuberculosis (TB) (44.4%), transverse myelitis (13.1%), Guillain-Barre syndrome (9.1%), metastatic spinal disease (4%), and HIV myelopathy (4%). However, the cause could not be identified in 14 (14%) of the patients. The commonest site of affectation in those with TB spine was lower thoracic (53.8%) and upper lumbar (23.1%) vertebrae.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: • We studied 90 patients who were consecutively recruited from the Department of Andrology of the Central Hospital of Asturias. • Anamnesis included questions about risk factors related to ED. • The severity of ED was classified according to IIEF-5 scores and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy were assessed using the NSS. • Neurophysiological tests included electromyography, nerve conduction studies, evoked potentials from pudendal and tibial nerves as well as bulbocavernosus reflex. • Small fibre function was assessed using quantitative sensory tests and sympathetic skin response. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS-11 program. RESULTS: • Patients with more severe symptoms of peripheral neuropathy showed lower (worse) IIEF-5 scores (P= 0.015) and required more aggressive therapies (P < 0.001). • Neurophysiological exploration confirmed neurological pathology in 68.9% of patients, of whom 7.8% had myelopathy and 61.1% peripheral neuropathy. • Polyneuropathy was found in 37.8% of the patients, of whom 8.9% had pure small fibre polyneuropathy, and pudendal neuropathy was diagnosed in 14.4%. • No association between neurophysiological diagnosis and IIEF-5 score was detected, but a statistical association was found between neuropathy and NSS scores. CONCLUSIONS: • Up to now, the impact of peripheral neuropathy in the pathogenesis of ED has been underestimated. The combination of anamnesis and an ad hoc neurophysiological protocol showed its high prevalence and provided a more accurate prognosis. • In future, clinical practice should optimize the assessment of pelvic small fibre function.","10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.10126.x","Adult; Aged; Electromyography; Erectile Dysfunction; Evoked Potentials; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Conduction; Neuropsychological Tests; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Pudendal Neuralgia; Reaction Time; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index","","Evaluation Study; Journal Article"
"21545957","Hysterectomy improves sexual response? Addressing a crucial omission in the literature.","Komisaruk BR; Frangos E; Whipple B","Journal of minimally invasive gynecology","2011","The prevailing view in the literature is that hysterectomy improves the quality of life. This is based on claims that hysterectomy alleviates pain (dyspareunia and abnormal bleeding) and improves sexual response. Because hysterectomy requires cutting the sensory nerves that supply the cervix and uterus, it is surprising that the reports of deleterious effects on sexual response are so limited. However, almost all articles that we encountered report that some of the women in the studies claim that hysterectomy is detrimental to their sexual response. It is likely that the degree to which a woman's sexual response and pleasure are affected by hysterectomy depends not only on which nerves were severed by the surgery, but also the genital regions whose stimulation the woman enjoys for eliciting sexual response. Because clitoral sensation (via pudendal and genitofemoral nerves) should not be affected by hysterectomy, this surgery would not diminish sexual response in women who prefer clitoral stimulation. However, women whose preferred source of stimulation is vaginal or cervical would be more likely to experience a decrement in sensation and consequently sexual response after hysterectomy because the nerves that innervate those organs, that is, the pelvic, hypogastric, and vagus nerves, are more likely to be damaged or severed in the course of hysterectomy. However, all published reports of the effects of hysterectomy on sexual response that we encountered fail to specify the women's preferred sources of genital stimulation. As discussed in the present review, we believe that the critical lack of information as to women's preferred sources of genital stimulation is key to accounting for the discrepancies in the literature as to whether hysterectomy improves or attenuates sexual pleasure.","10.1016/j.jmig.2011.01.012","Female; Genitalia, Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Ovariectomy; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Pleasure; Sensation; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

METHODS: Patients were seen and examined; medical records and radiological imaging were reviewed. The following data were collected prospectively: age; sex; the level of cauda equina (CE) compression; the pathology causing the compression; the clinical picture at first presentation; the causes of any iatrogenic injury; possible breaches of duty of care and the responsible discipline; recovery of bladder control; return to work. FINDINGS: There were possible breaches of duty of care for 39 patients initially, and for 69 patients overall. Twenty-eight patients presented with compressive degenerative pathologies (mainly central disc prolapses); all 28 had deteriorated to the point of bladder paralysis (complete CES (CESR)) at the time of treatment. Twenty-six (93%) had voluntary bladder control at presentation. Long-term bladder paralysis was probably avoidable in over 90% of patients. Eleven patients had iatrogenic injuries: all had long-term bladder paralysis. Thirty-four patients had bladder paralysis (CESR) at the point of decompressive surgery. Recovery of bladder function occurred in only seven patients (21%), i.e. long-term bladder outcomes were poor. Only 22% of patients returned to work. CONCLUSION: In this highly selected group of patients whose CES was not managed in an appropriate/standard fashion, 93% of patients had long-term bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction that was probably avoidable.

"21493175","Stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) for refractory index finger pain - a case report.","Hey M; Wilson I; Johnson MI","Annals of physical and rehabilitation medicine","2011","OBJECTIVE: To identify through case study the presentation and possible pathophysiological cause of complex regional pain syndrome and its preferential response to stellate ganglion blockade. SETTING: Complex regional pain syndrome can occur in an extremity after minor injury, fracture, surgery, peripheral nerve insult or spontaneously and is characterised by spontaneous pain, changes in skin temperature and colour, oedema, and motor disturbances. Pathophysiology is likely to involve peripheral and central components and neurological and inflammatory elements. There is no consistent approach to treatment with a wide variety of specialists involved. Diagnosis can be difficult, with over-diagnosis resulting from undue emphasis placed upon pain disproportionate to an inciting event despite the absence of other symptoms or under-diagnosed when subtle symptoms are not recognised. The International Association for the Study of Pain supports the use of sympathetic blocks to reduce sympathetic nervous system overactivity and relieve complex regional pain symptoms. Educational reviews promote stellate ganglion blockade as beneficial. Three blocks were given at 8, 10 and 13 months after the initial injury under local anaesthesia and sterile conditions. Physiotherapeutic input was delivered under block conditions to maximise joint and tissue mobility and facilitate restoration of function. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the need for practitioners from all disciplines to be able to identify the clinical characteristics of complex regional pain syndrome to instigate immediate treatment and supports the notion that stellate ganglion blockade is preferable to upper limb intravenous regional anaesthetic block for refractory index finger pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome.","10.1016/j.rehab.2011.03.001","Abdominal Pain; Accidental Falls; Acetaminophen; Adult; Amines; Autonomic Nerve Block; Chronic Disease; Codeine; Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids; Dyspareunia; Edema; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Electrodes, Implanted; Female; Finger Injuries; Fingers; Gabapentin; Humans; Immobilization; Morphine; Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy; Spinal Cord Injuries; Stellate Ganglion; Thoracic Vertebrae; Urinary Retention; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","","Case Reports; Journal Article"
"21479588","Neurophysiological characterization of persistent pain after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.","Linderoth G; Kehlet H; Aasvang EK; Werner MU","Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","2011","PURPOSE: About 2-5% of patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal repair experience persistent pain influencing everyday activities. However, compared with persistent pain after open repair, the combined clinical and neurophysiological characteristics have not been described in detail. Thus, the aim of the study was to describe and classify patients with severe persistent pain after laparoscopic herniorrhaphy. METHODS: Eleven patients with severe persistent pain following laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy were assessed in detail by their medical history, questionnaires (impairments of daily activities, pain description, psychological parameters, socio-economic status), physical examination, sensory mapping, and quantitative sensory testing. RESULTS: The median time since operation was 2 years (range 1-14 years). Ten patients experienced pain in the inguinal region and five patients had pain outside the inguinal region. Based upon the clinical pain pattern and the detailed quantitative sensory testing, the patients could be separated into three different entities, suggesting different pathogenic mechanisms leading to the persistent pain state. Four patients experienced dysejaculation. Six patients were unemployed or retired due to the postherniorrhaphy pain. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that patients with severe persistent pain after laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy belong to distinctive subgroups with indicators of either neuropathic, inflammatory, or mechanical irritation from the mesh, or a combination of these symptoms. The findings of a number of pain localizations outside the inguinal region demarcate it from persistent pain following open groin hernia repair. A classification based on a larger study group is required in order to define mechanism-based treatment strategies.","10.1007/s10029-011-0815-z","Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Chronic Pain; Cold Temperature; Employment; Hernia, Inguinal; Herniorrhaphy; Hot Temperature; Humans; Inflammation; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Neuralgia; Pain Measurement; Postoperative Pain; Pressure; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Somatosensory Disorders; Surgical Mesh; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Touch; Young Adult","","Journal Article"

On the basis of a genomewide association analysis using a (BDIV × BDIX) F(2) generation the Mss4 locus on rat chromosome 6 was predicted to mediate resistance to MPNST development in the trigeminal nerves, preferentially in females. F(2) females homozygous for D6Mit1 proved almost exclusively resistant to peripheral neurooncogenesis, with no effect detectable in males. To functionally verify Mss4, a congenic BDIX rat strain was generated carrying a corresponding BDIV genomic fragment. On treatment with ENU, congenic BDIX.BDIV-Mss4a rats showed a 2.4-fold lower MPNST rate and a 55-day-longer survival time compared with BDIX animals. The sex-specific effect observed in F(2) rats was less pronounced in BDIX.BDIV-Mss4a congenics, with males, too, being protected against MPNST but to a lesser extent than females. Transcription profiling using trigeminal nerve tissue of BDIX, BDIV, and BDIX.BDIV-Mss4a congenics of both sexes revealed 61 genes located in the Mss4a fragment differentially expressed between BDIV and BDIX rats. In congenic rats each gene either displayed trans-regulated BDIX-like expression strength or cis-regulated BDIV-like transcript levels or intermediate expression without marked sex differences. Genomewide a number of genes exhibiting male-biased expression in the BDIX rat strain displayed a reversal of the sexual dimorphism in congenic rats similar to the BDIV expression pattern, which might be the basis of preferential protection of females against MPNST development.","10.1152/physiolgenomics.00246.2010","Animals; Animals, Congenic; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Ethylnitrosourea; Female; Genetic Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors; Incidence; Male; Nerve Sheath Neoplasms; Rats; Rats, Transgenic; Sex Characteristics; Survival Analysis","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Although erectile dysfunction (ED) is a frequent complaint in patients with DM1, it has not been investigated in great depth. Hypogonadism, which is reported to be one of the physical causes of ED in the general population, frequently occurs in DM1. We planned this case-control study to evaluate the relationship between hypogonadism, as defined by the sexual hormone profile (FSH, LH, testosterone (T) and prolactin) and ED, as assessed by means of an internationally validated self-administered questionnaire (IIEF). DM1 patients had significantly increased mean levels of both gonadotropins (FSH and LH) (p < 0.0001) and a reduced mean level of T (p < 0.0001) when compared to controls. Twelve patients were eugonadic (normal LH, T, and FSH), while 18 displayed hormonal evidence of hypogonadism, characterized by tubular failure (increased FSH) in all the subjects and associated with interstitial failure in 14 subjects: seven with primary hypogonadism (increased LH and reduced T) and seven with compensated hypogonadism (increased LH and normal T). Patients with hormonal evidence of interstitial failure had a larger CTG expansion (p = 0.008), longer disease duration (p = 0.013), higher grade of disease (p = 0.004) and lower erectile function score (p = 0.02) than eugonadic patients.

The importance of unilateral posterior approach with preservation of posterior supporting element is emphasized. METHODS: Thirty-four patients had expansive laminoplasty. Posterior tension band consisting of nuchal ligaments and supraspinous and interspinous ligaments was secured. Paraspinal deep extensor muscles attached to one side of spinous process were also preserved. Hydroxyapatite-collagen spacers were positioned between split laminae in midline and secured with Ethibond. All patients had features of myelopathy with weakness, hypertonia, clonus, and hyperreflexia in both upper and lower limbs. Bladder and bowel involvement was seen in 11.7% and sexual dysfunction in 5.8%. Preoperative dynamic study of cervical spine, MRI, and/or CT were done in all patients and compared with postoperative studies to see the efficacy of the surgical procedure. RESULTS: Preoperative and postoperative neurosurgical cervical spine scale was used to compare results in relation to age, sex, duration of symptoms, neurosurgical cervical spine score, bladder, bowel, and sexual abnormalities. Elderly patients, lower neurosurgical score, signs and symptoms of more than 2 years, and bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction had poorer outcome. Complications were few. All patients had adequate diameter of spinal canal postoperatively. Cervical alignment and range of motion of segment subjected to laminoplasty were preserved satisfactorily in follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral open-door expansive laminoplasty using unilateral posterior midline approach provides preservation of posterior supporting tension band and excellent reconstruction of spinal canal. This technique also does not compromise contralateral paraspinal muscles attached to spinous process.","10.1007/s00701-010-0872-6","Aged; Cervical Vertebrae; Female; Humans; Laminectomy; Ligaments; Male; Middle Aged; Radiculopathy; Radiography; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Cord Compression","","Evaluation Study; Journal Article"

Spine","2011","OBJECT: Posterior epidural migration of a free disc fragment in the lumbar region is a very rare condition that has only been reported in isolated cases to date. Patients with this condition present with radiculopathy or major neurological deficits. Difficulties in diagnosis and the choice and timing of surgical treatment are important in these cases. In this clinical case series, features of cases with posterior epidural migration of free lumbar disc fragments accompanied by cauda equina syndrome are discussed. METHODS: Eight cases (0.27%) of posterior epidural migration of disc fragments were detected among 2880 patients surgically treated for lumbar disc herniation between 1995 and 2008. Seven of these patients had cauda equina syndrome. The mean duration of symptoms in the 8 cases was 4.2 days (range 1-10 days). The group included 6 men and 2 women, with a mean age of 48 years (range 34-72 years). The sequestered disc fragments were at the L3-4 level in 6 patients (75%) and the L4-5 level in 2 (25%). Magnetic resonance imaging showed tumor-like ring contrast enhancement around sequestered fragments in 5 patients. The patients' motor, sensory, sexual, and urological functions were evaluated postoperatively, and modified Odom criteria and a visual analog scale were used in the assessment of postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: A microsurgical approach was used in all cases. Sequestrectomy with minimal hemilaminotomy and removal of the free segments were performed. The patients were followed up for a mean period of 28.5 months. Three patients (37.5%) had excellent results, 3 (37.5%) had good results, 1 patient (12.5%) had fair results, and only 1 patient had poor results according to the Odom criteria. The main factors affecting the long-term outcomes were the presence of cauda equina syndrome and the time period between onset of symptoms and surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with posterior migration of a disc fragment present with severe neurological deficits such as cauda equina syndrome. Because the radiological images of disc fragments may mimic those of other more common posterior epidural space-occupying lesions, definite diagnosis of posteriorly located disc fragments is difficult. All of these lesions can be completely removed with hemilaminotomy and sequestrectomy, and early surgical treatment is important as a first choice to prevent severe neurological deficits.","10.3171/2010.11.SPINE10142","Adult; Aged; Epidural Space; Female; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Polyradiculopathy","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

In view of its profound impact on therapy and survival, we developed and validated a score to identify the presence of SCLC early in the course of LEMS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We derived a prediction score for SCLC in LEMS in a nationwide cohort of 107 Dutch patients, and validated it in a similar cohort of 112 British patients. A Dutch-English LEMS Tumor Association Prediction (DELTA-P) score was developed based on multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Age at onset, smoking behavior, weight loss, Karnofsky performance status, bulbar involvement, male sexual impotence, and the presence of Sry-like high-mobility group box protein 1 serum antibodies were independent predictors for SCLC in LEMS. A DELTA-P score was derived allocating 1 point for the presence of each of the following items at or within 3 months from onset: age at onset ≥ 50 years, smoking at diagnosis, weight loss ≥ 5%, bulbar involvement, erectile dysfunction, and Karnofsky performance status lower than 70. The area under the curve of the receiver operating curve was 94.4% in the derivation cohort and 94.6% in the validation set. A DELTA-P score of 0 or 1 corresponded to a 0% to 2.6% chance of SCLC, whereas scores of 4, 5, and 6 corresponded to chances of SCLC of 93.5%, 96.6%, and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The simple clinical DELTA-P score discriminated patients with LEMS with and without SCLC with high accuracy early in the course of LEMS.","10.1200/JCO.2010.32.0440","Adult; Age Distribution; Age of Onset; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Karnofsky Performance Status; Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome; Logistic Models; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Netherlands; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Distribution; Small Cell Lung Carcinoma; Survival Analysis; United Kingdom","","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Breast pain interferes with sexual activity, as reported by 48 percent of patients, exercise (36 percent), social activity (13 percent), and employment (6 percent). METHODS: To define neurogenic causes of chronic postoperative breast pain, the authors performed a retrospective review of consecutive patients from a single surgeon and performed 10 anatomical bilateral dissections. The authors evaluated the most commonly injured nerves, based on zone of injury, injury type, and precedent breast procedure. Dissections referenced the zone of injury with the specific procedure and designated the individual nerves at risk. RESULTS: The authors identified 57 patients with chronic breast pain from breast reconstruction (n = 38), reduction (n = 2), mastopexy (n = 2), augmentation (n = 4) and irradiation (n = 11). On the basis of anatomic innervation, the authors designated five zones of nerve injury: superior, medial, inferior, lateral, and central/nipple-areola complex. The lateral zone was most commonly injured (79 percent), followed by inferior (10.5 percent), medial (5 percent), central (3.5 percent), and superior (2 percent) zones. Forty-two patients suffered intercostal nerve neuromas from mechanical nerve trauma/entrapment, with pain at the surgical scar or nearby tissue dissection. Four patients with traction-stretch neuropathy had pain from blunt augmentation pocket dissection. Eleven patients with irradiation-induced neuropathy had diffuse, nonlocalized nerve pain. CONCLUSIONS: By shifting the approach to chronic breast pain from ""global chronic breast pain"" to defined danger zones of nerve injury, the practitioner can identify the type of nerve injury and associate the most common nerve injury to a given breast procedure. This approach should assist in diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately improve patient morbidity.","10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181f9587f","Breast; Chronic Disease; Female; Humans; Intercostal Nerves; Mammaplasty; Neuroma; Postoperative Pain; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies","","Journal Article"

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of the literature devoted to pelvic and perineal neuralgia. RESULTS: The diagnosis of pelvic and perineal pain related to a somatic nerve lesion is essentially clinical. The topography of the pain and its characteristics (burning, paraesthesia, etc.) can help to link the pain to the neurological territory involved. Complementary investigations are poorly contributive. Two main systems are involved in this region: sacral nerve roots that give rise to the pudendal nerve and the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh, thoracolumbar nerve roots that give rise to the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, genitofemoral and obturator nerves. The first system is essentially perineal and the second is essentially anterior inguinoperineal. DISCUSSION: Pudendal neuralgia is the most common and most disabling form of pelvic pain. It presents as unilateral or bilateral burning pain of the anterior or posterior perineum that is worse on sitting and relieved by standing, not usually associated with night pain. It is related to a ligamentous nerve compression mechanism. Inferior cluneal neuralgia tends to be experienced as ischial and lateroperineal pain, and is sometimes accompanied by pain in a truncated sciatic territory, corresponding to projections of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh. This neuralgia can be related to a piriformis syndrome or an ischial lesion. Sacral nerve root lesions do not cause acute pain, but are accompanied by sacral sensory loss and urinary, anorectal or sexual disorders. Pain related to ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric and genitofemoral nerves is generally secondary to surgical trauma and scars. Although these various lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other, an essential part of management consists of performing a local anesthetic block at the trigger point detected in the scar. Referred pain derived from the spinal cord due to thoracolumbar painful minor intervertebral dysfunction is experienced in the inguinal region, pubis, labium majorum and sometimes the trochanter, and only a complete clinical examination of the thoracolumbar region can demonstrate local signs (posterior facet joint pain at several levels, fibromyalgia).","10.1016/j.purol.2010.08.062","Chronic Disease; Humans; Neuralgia; Pelvic Pain; Pelvis; Perineum","","English Abstract; Journal Article; Review"

CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia is straightforward when the patient's symptoms remain confined to these diagnostic criteria, which are all essential for the diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a patient with low back and lower extremity pain suspected to result from lumbar radiculopathy but who was discovered to have symptomatic uterine fibroid (UF). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: UFs are usually asymptomatic but at times can produce symptoms such as excessive menstrual bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, pelvic pressure, bloating, dyspareunia, urinary and bowel disturbance, subfertility, and pregnancy-related complications. In rare cases, they can cause neural impingement leading to lower extremity pain, which can be mistaken for lumbar radiculopathy. METHODS: The patient was a 44-year-old woman who presented with low back pain and left leg pain. Examination suggested lumbar radiculopathy but lumbar magnetic resonance imaging was negative with the exception of a large mass in the pelvis. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging confirmed this to be a large UF. RESULTS: The patient's symptoms completely resolved following hysterectomy.

So far, ReGS has only been reported in females. AIM: To report the occurrence of ReGS in two males. METHODS: Two males with unwanted genital sensations presented in our clinic. In-depth interview, routine and hormonal investigations, electro-encephalography, magnetic resonance imaging of brain and pelvis, manual examination of the pubic bone, and sensory testing of genital dermatomes were performed. In both males, conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation was applied bilaterally at the pudendal dermatome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Oral report, questionnaire on frequency and intensity of restless genital feelings, restless legs, overactive bladder, and satisfaction with the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment. RESULTS: ReGS in a 74-year-old male manifested as unpleasant genital sensations of being on the edge of an orgasm with overactive bladder, in the absence of erection and ejaculation. Genital sensory testing elicited bilateral points of static mechanical hyperesthesia in the pudendal dermatome. Manual examination of the dorsal nerve of the penis (DNP) elicited the genital sensations. TENS application resulted in a 90% reduction of genital sensations and complaints of overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). ReGS in a 38-year-old male manifested as unwanted and unpleasant spontaneous ejaculations and complaints of OAB. Genital sensory testing elicited bilateral points of static mechanical hyperesthesia in the pudendal dermatome. Manual examination of the DNP elicited the genital sensations. TENS application had no effect on genital complaints and complaints of OAB. CONCLUSIONS: ReGS is not a typical female disorder as it also affects males.

On the other hand, some types of sport causing perineal compression, such as cycling, can exacerbate symptoms of acute and chronic prostatitis; a temporary sport discontinuation is justified in these patients. CP/CPPS may be often caused by pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE). Prostatitis-like urogenital neuropathic pain together with voiding and sexual dysfunctions are the hallmark of PNE. A common feature is that flexion activities of the hip, such as climbing, squatting, cycling provoke or worsen urogenital pain or pelvic pain. Many of the patients with PNE are cyclists, played American football, lifted weights, or wrestled as teenagers and young adults. PNE represents the most common bicycling associated urogenital problems. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, studies show that no causal relationship has been demonstrated between prostatitis and sporting activities. Conversely, urologists should be aware that sports involving vigorous hip flexion activities or prolonged perineal compression are a potential and not an infrequent cause of uroandrological symptoms caused by pudendal nerve entrapment.",NA,"Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Athletic Injuries; Bacterial Infections; Bicycling; Chronic Disease; Decompression, Surgical; Hip Joint; Humans; Male; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Neuralgia; Pelvic Pain; Perineum; Prostatitis; Sports; Urogenital System; Young Adult","","English Abstract; Journal Article; Review"

One of the main reasons of this complication is due to the dysfunction of the veins in corpus cavernosum. Recent studies have shown that the erectile function is improved after the long-term therapy of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor among patients with post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction. In this study, we evaluated the effects of mirodenafil on the penile erection and corpus cavernosum tissues in the rat model of cavernosal nerve injury. Rats were divided into four groups: (1) control group, (2) bilateral cavernosal nerve injury group, (3) mirodenafil 10 mg therapy group after the nerve injury and (4) mirodenafil 20 mg therapy group after the nerve injury. After we identified the nerve from the pelvic nerve complex on the lateral side of the prostate, the rats in the control group were sutured without causing any nerve injury and in other groups we damaged the nerve by compressing it with a vessel clamp. Then, 10 and 20 mg kg(-1) of mirodenafil were orally administered to two experimental groups. After 8 weeks, the intracavernosal pressure (ICP) was recorded. The immunohistochemical staining and western blot were performed, and the effect of mirodenafil on the expression of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was evaluated through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The ICP of nerve-injured group was decreased compared with the control group; however, the ICP of the mirodenafil-administered groups was improved compared with the nerve-injured group. The Masson's trichrome staining confirmed that the smooth muscle (SM) component was increased in the mirodenafil-administered groups. The nitric oxide synthase expression and cGMP of mirodenafil-administered groups was increased compared with the nerve-injured group. Long-term therapy of mirodenafil may improve the erectile function after the radical prostatectomy by preserving the SM content and inhibiting the fibrosis of the corpus cavernosum.","10.1038/ijir.2010.19","Animals; Cyclic GMP; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Male; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Penile Erection; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors; Postoperative Complications; Prostatectomy; Pyrimidinones; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sulfonamides","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Poly-Q-expanded AR accumulates in nuclei, undergoes fragmentation and initiates degeneration and loss of motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia. Phenotypically, patients present with weakness and wasting of the facial, bulbar and extremity muscles, sensory disturbances, and endocrinological disturbances, such as gynecomastia and reduced fertility. In the limb muscles weakness and wasting may be symmetric or asymmetric, proximal or distal, or may predominate at the lower or upper limb muscles. There may be mild to severe hyper-CK-emia, elevated testosterone or other sexual hormones, abnormal motor and sensory nerve conduction studies, and neuropathic or rarely myopathic alterations on muscle biopsy. BSMA is diagnosed if the number of CAG-repeats exceeds 40. No causal therapy is available but symptomatic therapy may be beneficial for weakness, tremor, endocrinological abnormalities, muscle cramps, respiratory failure, or dysphagia. The course is slowly progressive and the ability to walk lost only late in life. Only few patients require ventilatory support and life expectancy is only slightly compromised.","10.1016/j.jns.2010.08.025","Age of Onset; Bulbo-Spinal Atrophy, X-Linked; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Genetic Counseling; Heterozygote; History, 20th Century; Humans; Male; Phenotype; Prognosis","","Historical Article; Journal Article; Review"

The reduced efficacy of treatments makes novel therapeutic approaches to treat ED essential. The secreted protein Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is a critical regulator of penile smooth muscle and apoptosis that is decreased in cavernous nerve (CN) injury and diabetic ED models. Past studies using Affi-Gel beads have shown SHH protein to be effective in suppressing apoptosis caused by CN injury. AIM: We hypothesize that SHH protein delivered via novel peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofibers will be effective in suppressing CN injury-induced apoptosis. METHODS: Adult Sprague Dawley rats (n=50) were used to optimize PA injection in vivo. PA with SHH protein (n=16) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (control, n=14) was injected into adult rats that underwent bilateral CN cut. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, and 7 days. Alexa Fluor-labeled SHH protein was used to determine the target of SHH signaling (n=3). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis for SHH protein and cluster differentiation protein three (CD3) were performed. RESULTS: SHH-PA caused a 25% and 16% reduction in apoptosis at 4 and 7 days after CN injury and a 9.3% and 19% increase in SHH protein at 4 and 7 days after CN injury. CD3 protein was not observed in SHH-PA-treated penis. In vitro, 73% of SHH protein diffused from PA within 6 days. Labeled SHH was observed in smooth muscle. CONCLUSIONS: PA technology is effective in delivering SHH protein to the penis and SHH is effective in suppressing CN injury-induced apoptosis. These results suggest substantial translational potential of this methodology and show that only a short duration of SHH treatment is required to impact the apoptotic index.","10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02001.x","Animals; Apoptosis; Drug Carriers; Erectile Dysfunction; Hedgehog Proteins; Male; Muscle, Smooth; Nanofibers; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prostatectomy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","","Evaluation Study; Journal Article"

Painful paresthesia radiating to the right side of the patient's penis and right leg was experienced shortly after needle insertion. The needle was immediately withdrawn and redirected laterally. Motor responses for the common peroneal and tibial components of the sciatic nerve were elicited at 0.48 mA in both cases and a 10-mL bolus of mepivacaine 1.5% was injected onto each component. The sciatic nerve block was combined with a femoral nerve block to facilitate a knee arthroscopy. The trauma resulted in erectile dysfunction and partial loss of penile sensation as well as evidence of injury to the sciatic nerve itself.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of a classification scheme of CES based on factors including clinical symptoms, imaging signs, and electrophysiological findings. METHODS: The records of 39 patients with CES were divided into 4 groups based on clinical features as follows. Group 1 (preclinical): low back pain with only bulbocavernosus reflex and ischiocavernosus reflex abnormalities. Group 2 (early): saddle sensory disturbance and bilateral sciatica. Group 3 (middle): saddle sensory disturbance, bowel or bladder dysfunction, motor weakness of the lower extremity, and reduced sexual function. Group 4 (late): absence of saddle sensation and sexual function in addition to uncontrolled bowel function. The outcome including radiographic and electrophysiological findings was compared between groups. RESULTS: The main clinical manifestations of CES included bilateral saddle sensory disturbance, and bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction. The clinical symptoms of patients with multiple-segment canal stenosis identified radiographically were more severe than those of patients with single-segment stenosis. BCR and ICR improved in groups 1 and 2 after surgery, but no change was noted for groups 3 and 4. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that bilateral radiculopathy or sciatica are early stages of CES and indicate a high risk of development of advanced CES. Electrophysiological abnormalities and reduced saddle sensation are indices of early diagnosis. Patients at the preclinical and early stages have better functional recovery than patients in later stages after surgical decompression.","10.3109/17453674.2010.483985","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Decompression, Surgical; Defecation; Early Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Selection; Penile Erection; Polyradiculopathy; Retrospective Studies; Sensation Disorders; Urination","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Identification of predisposing factors may help to identify the risk groups and guide anesthetic or surgical procedures in reducing risk for PPP. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 464 patients undergoing open or laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal elective groin hernia repair. Primary outcome was identification of risk factors for substantial pain-related functional impairment at 6 months postoperatively assessed by the validated Activity Assessment Scale (AAS). Data on potential risk factors for PPP were collected preoperatively (pain from the groin hernia, preoperative AAS score, pain from other body regions, and psychometric assessment). Pain scores were collected on days 7 and 30 postoperatively. Sensory functions including pain response to tonic heat stimulation were assessed by quantitative sensory testing preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively to assess nerve damage. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-four patients were included, whereof 442 were examined at 6 months (95.3% follow-up). Fifty-five patients (12.4%) had ""moderate/severe"" PPP at 6 months. Logistic regression analysis identified four risk factors for PPP: preoperative AAS score, preoperative pain to tonic heat stimulation, 30-day postoperative pain intensity, and sensory dysfunction in the groin at 6 months (nerve damage) (all P < 0.03). A risk prediction model of only preoperative factors and choice of surgical technique revealed increased preoperative AAS score, increased preoperative pain to heat stimulation, and open surgery to increase the risk for PPP (all P < 0.02). CONCLUSION: PPP is related to both patient and surgical factors. Patients with a high preoperative AAS score and high pain response to a standardized heat stimulus may preferably be treated using an operative technique with lowest risk for nerve damage.","10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181d31ff8","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Cohort Studies; Digestive System Surgical Procedures; Endpoint Determination; Erectile Dysfunction; Female; Forecasting; Germany; Groin; Herniorrhaphy; Humans; Intraoperative Period; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Neurologic Examination; Pain Measurement; Postoperative Pain; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Preoperative Care; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sample Size; Socioeconomic Factors; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Previously, a similar clinical syndrome has been reported as being caused by inflammatory demyelination of peripheral nerve fibres. Here, we investigated in detail the immunopathology of this paretic syndrome and its possible resemblance to human neuropathies. METHODS: Neurologically affected chickens and control animals from one single flock underwent clinical and neuropathological examination. Peripheral nervous system (PNS) alterations were characterised using standard morphological techniques, including nerve fibre teasing and transmission electron microscopy. Infiltrating cells were phenotyped immunohistologically and quantified by flow cytometry. The cytokine expression pattern was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). These investigations were accomplished by MHC genotyping and a PCR screen for Marek's disease virus (MDV). RESULTS: Spontaneous paresis of White Leghorns is caused by cell-mediated, inflammatory demyelination affecting multiple cranial and spinal nerves and nerve roots with a proximodistal tapering. Clinical manifestation coincides with the employment of humoral immune mechanisms, enrolling plasma cell recruitment, deposition of myelin-bound IgG and antibody-dependent macrophageal myelin-stripping. Disease development was significantly linked to a 539 bp microsatellite in MHC locus LEI0258. An aetiological role for MDV was excluded. CONCLUSIONS: The paretic phase of avian inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis immunobiologically resembles the late-acute disease stages of human acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and is characterised by a Th1-to-Th2 shift.","10.1186/1742-2094-7-7","Animals; Antigens, CD; Chickens; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Flow Cytometry; Ganglia, Spinal; Genotype; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Logistic Models; Major Histocompatibility Complex; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Neurosyphilis; Plant Lectins; Spinal Cord; Spinal Nerves; Viral Envelope Proteins","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

There are an estimated 60 million people living with and 340 million with treatable STIs. Surveys show sexual problems to be as high as 35% for men and 55% for women; however, there is little research directly assessing relationships between infection and sexual function. AIM: To show that STIs are associated with (and may cause) sexual dysfunction. Conversely, sexual dysfunction can increase patients' risk of STI acquisition. In men, erectile dysfunction (ED) associated with condom use may lead to unsafe sexual practices and, hence, STI acquisition. The role of various therapies including phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the treatment of ED in positive men taking social drugs will be explored. METHODS: To provide state-of-the-art knowledge concerning sexual function and STIs, representing the opinions of five experts from four countries developed in a consensus process and encompassing a detailed literature review over a 2-year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Expert opinion was based on the grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate. RESULTS: This article highlights major factors causing the spread of STIs and suggests management interventions to prevent further spread of HIV/STIs, focusing on the juxtaposition between STIs and sexual functioning. Women's unique vulnerabilities to HIV/STIs (biological and physiological issues, gender-based violence, gender inequity) and their impact on women's sexual function are reviewed. Similarly, men's unique vulnerabilities to HIV/STIs including condom use, disclosure, voluntary counseling and testing, multiple concurrent sexual partners, and recreational drug use--particularly in homosexual men--are explored, as is the association of prostatitis and sexual function. Lastly, the article reviews the relationship between circumcision and sexual dysfunction.

"20060652","The role of sexual intercourse in the etiology of carpal tunnel syndrome.","Zenian J","Medical hypotheses","2010","The etiology of non-occupational carpal tunnel syndrome is not well understood. It is proposed that carpal tunnel syndrome can develop during sexual intercourse when the hands become repeatedly extended while under pressure from the weight of the upper body. Of the eight risk factors associated with non-occupational carpal tunnel syndrome, age, marital status, pregnancy and use of hormonal agents can be explained by changes in the frequency of sexual intercourse. On the other hand, obesity, macromastia and large chest circumference can be explained by the increased pressure imposed on the wrists by the heavier upper body associated with such conditions. The bilaterality of carpal tunnel syndrome can be explained by the fact that both hands are needed to support the upper body during sexual intercourse. A parallel decrease in the frequency of sexual intercourse and the incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome between the sixth and the seventh decades of life suggests a possible cause and effect relationship between sexual intercourse and carpal tunnel syndrome.","10.1016/j.mehy.2009.12.015","Age Factors; Body Weight; Carpal Tunnel Syndrome; Coitus; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Risk Factors","","Journal Article"

OBJECTIVES: The neuroanatomy and physiology of psychogenic erection, cholinergic versus adrenergic innervation of emission and the predictability of outcome of vibration and electroejaculation require a review and synthesis. SETTING: University Hospital Belgium. METHODS: We reviewed the literature with PubMed 1973-2008. RESULTS: Erection, emission and ejaculation are separate phenomena and have different innervations. It is important to realize, which are the afferents and efferents and where the motor neuron of the end organ is located. When interpreting a specific lesion it is important to understand if postsynaptic fibres are intact or not. Afferents of erection, emission and ejaculation are the pudendal nerve and descending pathways from the brain. Erection is cholinergic and NO-mediated. Emission starts cholinergically (as a secretion) and ends sympathetically (as a contraction). Ejaculation is mainly adrenergic and somatic. For vibratory-evoked ejaculation, the reflex arch must be complete; for electroejaculation, the postsynaptic neurons (paravertebral ganglia) must be intact. CONCLUSION: Afferents of erection, emission and ejaculation are the pudendal nerve and descending pathways from the brain. Erection is cholinergic and NO-mediated. Emission starts cholinergically (as a secretion) and ends sympathetically (as a contraction). Ejaculation is mainly adrenergic and somatic. In neurogenic disease, a good knowledge of neuroanatomy and physiology makes understanding of sexual dysfunction possible and predictable.

One of the possible mechanisms of post-TURP erectile dysfunction (ED) is direct thermal injury to the erectile nerves. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TURP on erectile function. Fifty patients undergoing TURP for obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia (HBP) were prospectively included in the study, and 50 age-matched patients undergoing transurethral resection of the superficial bladder tumor were also prospectively included as a control group. All patients completed the international index of erectile function (IIEF-15), the international prostatic symptom score (IPSS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at inclusion in the study and then at the 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluation. Capsular perforations during TURP were prospectively reported by the operating surgeon. There was a significant improvement of erectile function in the TURP group despite the onset of ejaculation disorders in 70% of the patients. Improvement of erectile function was also found in the subgroup of patients with capsular perforation during TURP. Comparison with the control group showed that at preoperative evaluation, patients in the TURP group had more severe urinary symptoms and worse erectile function than did those of the control group. At the postoperative period, the IPSS score became comparable in the two groups, with major improvement of erectile function in the TURP group. We concluded that TURP improved erectile function in HBP patients with severe urinary symptoms. This improvement of erectile function was observed even in case of capsular perforation.","10.1038/ijir.2009.56","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Coitus; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Orgasm; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prospective Studies; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Severity of Illness Index; Transurethral Resection of Prostate","","Comparative Study; Journal Article"

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors that contribute to improved local control and survival. In addition, we sought to define the expected morbidity associated with treatment. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sacral chordomas are rare tumors presumed to arise from notochordal cells. Local recurrence presents a major problem in the management of these tumors and it has been correlated with survival. Resection of sacral tumors is associated with significant morbidity. METHODS: Forty-two patients underwent resection for sacral chordoma between 1990 and 2005. Twelve patients had their initial surgery elsewhere. There were 12 female and 30 male patients. The proximal extent of the sacrectomy was at least S2 in 32 patients. RESULTS: Median survival was 84 months, and 5-year disease-free (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSF) were 56% and 77%, respectively. Local recurrence (LR) and metastasis occurred in 17 (40%) and 13 (31%) patients, respectively. Local recurrence (P=0.0001), metastasis (P=0.0001), prior resection (P=0.046), and higher grade (P=0.05) were associated with a worse DSF. Prior resections (P=0.0001) and intralesional resections (P=0.01) were associated with a higher rate of LR. Intralesional resections were associated with a lower DSF (P=0.0001). Wide contaminated margins treated with cryosurgery and/or radiation were not associated with a higher LR rate. Rectus abdominus flaps were associated with decreased wound complications (P=0.01). Thirty-one (74%) patients reported that they self catheterize; and 16 (38%) patients required bowel training, while an additional twelve (29%) patients had a colostomy. Twenty-eight (67%) patients reported sexual dysfunction. Two (5%) patients died due to sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Intralesional resection should be avoided as it is associated with a higher LR rate and worse survival. Rectus abdominus flaps ought to be considered as they lower the wound complication rate. Sacral resection is associated with significant morbidity.","10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181bad11d","Chordoma; Cryotherapy; Disease-Free Survival; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neurosurgical Procedures; Polyradiculopathy; Postoperative Complications; Radiography; Radiotherapy; Rectus Abdominis; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Sacrum; Spinal Neoplasms; Surgical Flaps; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic","","Journal Article"

We report the case of a 64-year-male with acute onset wrist drop and foot drop, secondary to HCV-MC related mononeuritis multiplex, who was treated with rituximab, an anti-CD20(+) antibody directed against B cells. We monitored the frequency of B-cell subsets in peripheral blood before and after rituximab, and correlated B-cell subset changes with clinical response. Significant improvements in his wrist and foot drop, as well as his vasculitic rash, depression and erectile dysfunction were evident within six days of starting rituximab and have persisted several months after B-cell recovery. More than 95% of CD20(+) B cells had disappeared from peripheral blood within 1 week, returning to baseline by week 21. CD20(+)CXCR3(+) frequency at baseline was similar to that at week 21. CD20(+)CD5(+), the human equivalent of B1 B cells and CD20(+)IgM(+)IgD(+), naïve B cells were increased. By contrast, CD20(+)CD27(+) memory cell frequency was reduced.

DATA SOURCES: Relevant literature sourced through Medline, Embase, and CINAHL using the key search words ""cauda equina syndrome"" combined with ""definition,"" ""clinical presentation,"" ""signs and symptoms,"" ""pathology,"" and ""etiology."" STUDY SELECTION: Not applicable. DATA EXTRACTION: Not applicable. DATA SYNTHESIS: Three reviewers independently extracted data on CES from the literature specific to its definition, clinical presentation, and etiology. Of 111 articles, 105 were included for review, and relevant information on CES was synthesized into a framework structured as per a clinical consultation. A content analysis was then conducted using the method adopted by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy whereby the level of consensus for each sign and symptom of CES was determined by its percentage coverage within the literature: 100% coverage equals unanimity, 75% to 99% equals consensus, 51% to 74% equals majority view, and 0% to 50% equals no consensus. This enabled the frequency of each reported sign and symptom to be ranked. Articles that included specific definitions for CES were divided into 3 categories: those that (1) included generalized statements, (2) stated a pathomechanical basis, and (3) defined the syndrome by its clinical presentation. Throughout this review, the frequencies of specific etiologies and pathologies were noted. Together with details of clinical presentation, this enabled a comprehensive review of CES. No single aspect of CES within the literature achieved unanimity or consensus; however, a majority view indicated that there would be bladder and sensory disturbance (74% and 66% of all articles, respectively). The most commonly cited pathology resulting in CES was identified as the disk (45% of all articles reviewed). CONCLUSIONS: There are marked inconsistencies in the current evidence base surrounding the etiology and clinical presentation of CES, with 17 definitions identified. Subclassifications of the definition of CES are ambiguous and should be avoided. From reviewing 105 articles, a single definition of CES is proposed. For a diagnosis of CES, one or more of the following must be present: (1) bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, (2) reduced sensation in the saddle area, and (3) sexual dysfunction, with possible neurologic deficit in the lower limb (motor/sensory loss, reflex change).","10.1016/j.apmr.2009.03.021","Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Polyradiculopathy","","Journal Article; Review"

Muscle strength and function correlated directly with serum testosterone levels and inversely with CAG repeat length, age and duration of weakness. Motor unit number estimation was decreased by about half compared to healthy controls. Sensory nerve action potentials were reduced in nearly all subjects. Quantitative muscle assessment and timed 2 min walk may be useful as meaningful indicators of disease status.

Conservative treatment is often unsuccessful. Selective neurectomy may be effective, but long-term results are scarce. The authors assessed the long-term efficacy of surgical neurectomy for chronic, postherniorrhaphy groin neuralgia. METHODS: A registry of patients with postherniorrhaphy groin pain treated by neurectomy was analyzed. Patients received a questionnaire evaluating the current pain intensity, overall treatment results, and effects on sexual intercourse-related pain. The risk factors for failure and presence of a learning curve were investigated. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients underwent a neurectomy over a 5-year time period, 49 of whom responded to the questionnaire (response rate, 91%). After a median follow-up period of 1.5 years, 52% claimed to be pain free or almost pain free (good to excellent), 24% reported some relief but still felt pain at a regular basis (moderate), and 24% did not benefit (poor or worse). Sexual intercourse-related pain responded favorably to neurectomy in two thirds of patients. There seemed to be a steep learning curve, and poor treatment results depended on previously received pain regimens (P = .021). CONCLUSION: A selective operative neurectomy for postherniorrhaphy groin neuralgia provides good long-term pain relief in most patients. Hernia surgeons should feel responsible for this iatrogenic complication and should consider incorporating selective neurectomy in their surgical armamentarium.","10.1016/j.surg.2009.08.008","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Groin; Hernia, Inguinal; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Neuralgia; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pain Measurement; Postoperative Complications; Surgical Mesh; Young Adult","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The aim of this study was to identify and present patients in whom cauda equina lesions occurred after spinal surgery. From the author's series of patients with cauda equina lesions, those with the appearance of sacral symptoms after spinal surgery were identified. To demonstrate lesions more objectively, electrodiagnostic studies were performed in addition to history and clinical examination. Imaging studies were also reviewed. Of 69 patients from the series, 11 patients in whom a cauda equina lesion developed after spinal surgery were identified. The aetiology comprised surgery for herniated intervertebral disc in 5 (4 performed by a single surgeon), spinal stenosis surgery in 4, and postoperative lumbar epidural haematoma in 2 patients (each performed by a different surgeon). Proportion of spinal surgeries with this complication varied from 0 to 6.6 per thousand in different centres. Patients with iatrogenic cauda equina lesion were significantly older (p < 0.001), and reported more severe urinary, but similar bowel and sexual symptoms compared to other patients in the series. In conclusion the study identified spinal surgery as the cause of approximately 15% of cauda equina lesions. More than a third of lesions developed after procedures performed by a single surgeon. Most of the remaining lesions could probably be avoided by better surgical technique (e.g. the use of a high-speed drill instead of a Kerrison rongeur in patients with severe spinal stenosis), or prevented by closer postoperative monitoring (e.g. in patients with postoperative lumbar epidural haematoma).","10.1007/s00586-009-1170-y","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Diagnosis, Differential; Electrodiagnosis; Female; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Procedures; Polyradiculopathy; Postoperative Period; Spine; Statistics, Nonparametric; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The social nerve, it controls erection and the voluntary sphincters. It is also the nerve of the beginnings of sexual sensation and masturbation. Its injury is expressed in perineal pain, which, when positional, suggests a tunnel syndrome. The compression points have become well known: ligament pinching between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments, the falciform process and the pudendal canal (Alcock canal). The data from questioning the patient, the results of the neurological exam, and the at least momentary response to infiltration define the Nantes criteria, which confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is medical, physical therapy, infiltration, and, as a last resort, surgery. The results have improved because of new technical norms, with 75% of operated patients benefiting from surgery.

AIM: To investigate distinct localizations of ReGS. METHODS: Twenty-three women, fulfilling all five criteria of persistent genital arousal disorder were included into the study. In-depth interviews, routine and hormonal investigations, electroencephalographs, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and pelvis were performed in all women. The localizations of genital sensations were investigated by physical examination of the ramus inferior of the pubic bone (RIPB) and by sensory testing of the skin of the genital area with a cotton swab (genital tactile mapping test or GTM test). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity of RIPB, GTM test. RESULTS: Of 23 women included in the study, 18(78%), 16(69%), and 12(52%) reported restless legs syndrome, overactive bladder syndrome, and urethra hypersensitivity. Intolerance of tight clothes and underwear (allodynia or hyperpathia) was reported by 19 (83%) women. All women were diagnosed with ReGS. Sitting aggravated ReGS in 20(87%) women. In all women, MRI showed pelvic varices of different degree in the vagina (91%), labia minora and/or majora (35%), and uterus (30%). Finger touch investigation of the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (DNC) along the RIPB provoked ReGS in all women. Sensory testing showed unilateral and bilateral static mechanical Hyperesthesia on various trigger points in the dermatome of the pudendal nerve, particularly in the part innervated by DNC, including pelvic bone. In three women, sensory testing induced an uninhibited orgasm during physical examination. CONCLUSIONS: ReGS is highly associated with pelvic varices and with sensory neuropathy of the pudendal nerve and DNC, whose symptoms are suggestive for small fiber neuropathy (SFN). Physical examination for static mechanical Hyperesthesia is a diagnostic test for ReGS and is recommended for all individuals with complaints of persistent restless genital arousal in absence of sexual desire.","10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01435.x","Adult; Aged; Arousal; Clitoris; Female; Humans; Hyperesthesia; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Orgasm; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Vagina; Women's Health","","Journal Article"

In many cases, the symptoms may be localised to a single end organ. However, the involvement of the central nervous system may result in a complex regional pain syndrome affecting the whole pelvis and as a consequence, multiple-organ symptomatology. The initial trigger may be relatively benign but a predisposed individual may develop a range of significant sensory and efferent functional abnormalities. Stimuli not normally reaching threshold may be perceived and normal sensations may be magnified to become dysphoric or painful. Problems of emptying viscera and maintaining continence may occur. Significant musculoskeletal disability may arise as well as abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system. There is an association with systemic disorders. Also, psychological, behavioural, sexual and social problems arise.

The free fraction can be measured by equilibrium dialysis or calculated using published algorithms. The term bioavailable testosterone refers to unbound testosterone plus albumin-bound testosterone; this term reflects the view that, in addition to unbound testosterone, albumin-bound testosterone is readily dissociable and thus bioavailable. Bioavailable testosterone can be measured by precipitation methods or calculated from total testosterone, SHBG, albumin concentrations and their affinity constants. Free testosterone measurements by analog methods are frequently available, but these measurements are affected by alterations in SHBG and are inaccurate.

Study selection Original milestone articles and critical reviews written by major pioneer investigators about the cauda equina syndrome were selected. RESULTS: CES is rare, both atraumatically and traumatically. Males and females are equally affected. The incidence of CES is variable, depending on the etiology of the syndrome. The most common cause of CES is herniation of a lumbar intervertebral disc. CES symptoms may have sudden onset and evolve rapidly or sometimes chronic ally. Each type of CES has different typical signs and symptoms. Low back pain may be the most significant symptoms, accompanied by sciatica, lower extremities weakness, saddle or perianal hypoesthesia, sexual impotence, and sphincter dysfunction. MRI is usually the preferred investigation approach. Patients who have had CES are difficult to return to a normal status.

The etiology of CP/CPPS is noninfectious, with no precise mechanisms has been elucidated to date. HYPOTHESIS: During male ejaculation, the pelvic muscles undergo coordinated intense contraction to expel the semen out of the male genital tract, a process associated with locally increased levels of lactic acid and free radicals as byproducts. In this regards, repetitive sexual activities with frequent ejaculation would impede the drainage and cause accumulation of these byproducts in the pelvic region, triggering consequent local pathophysiological changes such as edema, venous dilation and muscular malfunction, which further leads to common complaints in CP/CPPS patients such as lower urinary tract symptoms, pelvic discomfort and pain. RATIONALE: Large cohort studies have revealed that frequent ejaculation is associated with higher risk of prostatitis, especially in young men. Also, clear evidences from sports medical research has shown that intense muscular contraction will lead to locally increased production of free radicals and lactic acid. Therefore, the pelvic muscles during ejaculation would induce substantial increase of these byproducts, which if not cleared effectively, could trigger series of local cellular/tissue damages resulting in inflammation, muscular fatigue and dysfunction. If our hypothesis were validated, it could be suggested that at least in some patients, the treatment of CP/CPPS could be tuned as dealing with post-sports recovery, such as hot bath to promote local blood circulation and free radical scavenger drugs such as vitamin C and E to neutralize free radicals.","10.1016/j.mehy.2009.03.044","Chronic Disease; Ejaculation; Free Radicals; Humans; Lactic Acid; Male; Models, Immunological; Myositis; Pelvic Pain; Prostatitis; Syndrome","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
"19325530","Cluster of ciguatera fish poisoning--North Carolina, 2007.","","MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report","2009","Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is a distinctive type of foodborne disease that results from eating predatory ocean fish contaminated with ciguatoxins. As many as 50,000 cases are reported worldwide annually, and the condition is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific basin, Indian Ocean, and Caribbean. In the United States, 5--70 cases per 10,000 persons are estimated to occur yearly in ciguatera-endemic states and territories. CFP can cause gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, or diarrhea) within a few hours of eating contaminated fish. Neurologic symptoms, with or without gastrointestinal disturbance, can include fatigue, muscle pain, itching, tingling, and (most characteristically) reversal of hot and cold sensation. This report describes a cluster of nine cases of CFP that occurred in North Carolina in June 2007. Among the nine patients, six experienced reversal of hot and cold sensations, five had neurologic symptoms only, and overall symptoms persisted for more than 6 months in three patients. Among seven patients who were sexually active, six patients also complained of painful intercourse. This report highlights the potential risks of eating contaminated ocean fish. Local and state health departments can train emergency and urgent care physicians in the recognition of CFP and make them aware that symptoms can persist for months to years.",NA,"Adult; Animals; Ciguatera Poisoning; Disease Outbreaks; Diuretics, Osmotic; Dyspareunia; Female; Humans; Male; Mannitol; North Carolina; Perciformes; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Seafood","","Journal Article"

METHODS: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were purified with density gradient centrifugation. A 10 mm defect of hypogastric nerve was created in 9 Beagle dogs and the 18 hypogastric nerves were randomly divided into three groups. Group A: nerve defects bridged with copolymer of lactic and glycolic acids (PLGA) tube containing BMSCs and collagen protein sponge. Group B: with PLGA tube only containing collagen protein sponge. Group C: with autologous nerve graft. The effect of nerve recovery was evaluated by morphology, HE staining, neurofilament immunohistochemistry staining, electron microscope scanning and measurement quantity of new axon 12 weeks after the transplantation. RESULTS: Twelve weeks after the transplantation, degradation of PLGA tubes showed in group A and group B. The nerves regenerated through defect area to distal end. The density of regeneration nerve fiber in group A and group C were better than that in group B. The difference was significant between group A or group C and group B (P<0.05), and no significant difference was observed between group A and group C(P>0.05).

"19242385","Experience of menopausal symptoms by women in an urban community in Ibadan, Nigeria.","Olaolorun FM; Lawoyin TO","Menopause (New York, N.Y.)","2009","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of menopausal symptoms among women in Ibadan in the 4-week period preceding the survey and factors associated with these symptoms. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional, community-based study was carried out on Nigerian women aged 40 to 60 years, using the multistage sampling technique. Quantitative data were collected on sociodemographic, obstetric, and gynecological variables as well as symptom experience in the preceding 4 weeks using a structured questionnaire that included a standardized Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). Eleven symptom groups were scored for each respondent on a scale of 0-4, with increasing severity for each score and a maximal total score of 44. The MRS is made of three subscales (somatovegetative, psychological, and urogenital) with maximal scores of 16, 16, and 12, respectively. Scores for each subscale and the overall total score were calculated for each respondent, and these served as the main outcome measures. The higher the composite score, the greater the severity of menopausal symptoms. RESULTS: In all, 1,189 women with a mean age of 48.1 +/- 5.9 years were interviewed. Prevalence of any menopausal symptom was 84.5% during the 4-week period studied. Joint and muscular discomfort was the most common reported symptom among all women in this study (59.0%), followed by physical and mental exhaustion (43.0%), sexual problems (40.4%), and hot flashes (39.0%). Factors predicting the total score on the MRS were age of respondent (P = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.02-0.17), menopause status (P = 0.001; 95% CI, 0.33-1.24), and occupational group (P = 0.02; 95% CI, 0.10-1.42). Age of respondent and menopause status also predicted scores on the somatovegetative and urogenital subscales, but not on the psychological subscale. Occupation was the only predictor on the psychological subscale (P = 0.002; 95% CI, 0.16-0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of menopausal symptoms was high among women in this study. Although any woman could face challenges associated with menopausal symptoms, those who were older, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal and who had routine or manual occupations had the highest total MRS scores. All women, especially those in these categories, should receive health information and guidance on possible lifestyle adjustments to ease the disruptions that menopausal symptoms can cause.","10.1097/gme.0b013e318198d6e7","Adult; Age Factors; Arthralgia; Educational Status; Fatigue; Female; Hot Flashes; Humans; Menopause; Mental Fatigue; Middle Aged; Muscular Diseases; Nigeria; Occupations; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Urban Population","","Journal Article"

Here we review the statin AE literature, first focusing on muscle AEs as the most reported problem both in the literature and by patients. Evidence regarding the statin muscle AE mechanism, dose effect, drug interactions, and genetic predisposition is examined. We hypothesize, and provide evidence, that the demonstrated mitochondrial mechanisms for muscle AEs have implications to other nonmuscle AEs in patients treated with statins. In meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), muscle AEs are more frequent with statins than with placebo. A number of manifestations of muscle AEs have been reported, with rhabdomyolysis the most feared. AEs are dose dependent, and risk is amplified by drug interactions that functionally increase statin potency, often through inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 system. An array of additional risk factors for statin AEs are those that amplify (or reflect) mitochondrial or metabolic vulnerability, such as metabolic syndrome factors, thyroid disease, and genetic mutations linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Converging evidence supports a mitochondrial foundation for muscle AEs associated with statins, and both theoretical and empirical considerations suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may also underlie many nonmuscle statin AEs. Evidence from RCTs and studies of other designs indicates existence of additional statin-associated AEs, such as cognitive loss, neuropathy, pancreatic and hepatic dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction. Physician awareness of statin AEs is reportedly low even for the AEs most widely reported by patients. Awareness and vigilance for AEs should be maintained to enable informed treatment decisions, treatment modification if appropriate, improved quality of patient care, and reduced patient morbidity.","10.2165/0129784-200808060-00004","Drug Interactions; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Mitochondria; Mitochondria, Muscle; Muscular Diseases; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rhabdomyolysis; Risk Factors","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into three equal groups: eight had a sham operation, eight underwent bilateral nerve crushing with no further intervention and eight underwent bilateral nerve crushing with an immediate application of PRP on the site of injury. Erectile function was assessed by CN electrostimulation at 3 months and nerve regeneration was assessed by toluidine blue staining of CN and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase staining of penile tissue. Three months after surgery, in the group that underwent bilateral nerve crushing with no further intervention, the functional evaluation showed a lower mean maximal intracavernous pressure (ICP) and maximal ICP per mean arterial pressure (MAP) with CN stimulation than those in the sham group. In the group with an immediate application of PRP, the mean maximal ICP and maximal ICP/MAP were significantly higher than those in the injured control group. Histologically, the group with the application of PRP had more myelinated axons of CNs and more NADPH-diaphorase-positive nerve fibres than the injured control group but fewer than the sham group. These results show that the application of PRP to the site of CN-crush injury facilitates nerve regeneration and recovery of erectile function.

METHODS: A group of 22 control men and a group of 53 men with chronic cauda equina lesions (patients) were studied. The penilo-cavernosus reflex was elicited clinically and measured neurophysiologically using single and double electrical stimulation. The sensory threshold, reflex threshold and stimulation strength in all controls, and latency of the response in all subjects, were compared to reference intervals. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios of the penilo-cavernosus reflex testing were calculated. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the penilo-cavernosus reflex was 72-83% and 81-83%, specificity 52-57% and 90-91%, positive predictive value 83-97% and 95-96%, negative predictive value 52-57% and 66-68%, and likelihood ratios 1.9-2.8 and 8.3-9.0 for clinical (circumcised subjects: included/excluded; reflex pathologic when diminished/non-elicitable) and neurophysiologic testing (using three stimulation modalities), respectively. Specificities of the sensory threshold, reflex threshold and stimulation strength were approximately 90% or higher. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated higher specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios of neurophysiologic testing of the penilo-cavernosus reflex compared to clinical testing. The results support the use of clinical penilo-cavernosus reflex testing as an addition to bladder emptying difficulties and saddle sensory loss as criteria for patient referral for uro-neurophysiologic examination, and measurement of the reflex as a valuable part of such testing.

The lack of an AChR subunit causes a fetal akinesia in humans, leading to death in the first trimester and characteristic features of Fetal Akinesia Deformation Sequences (FADS). A corresponding null mutation of the delta-subunit in zebrafish (sofa potato; sop) leads to the death of embryos around 5 d postfertilization (dpf). In sop(-/-) mutants, we expressed modified delta-subunits, with one (delta1YFP) or two yellow fluorescent protein (delta2YFP) molecules fused at the intracellular loop, under the control of an alpha-actin promoter. AChRs containing these fusion proteins are fluorescent, assemble on the plasma membrane, make clusters under motor neuron endings, and generate synaptic current. We screened for germ-line transmission of the transgene and established a line of sop(-/-) fish stably expressing the delta2YFP. These delta2YFP/sop(-/-) embryos can mount escape behavior close to that of their wild-type siblings. Synaptic currents in these embryos had a smaller amplitude, slower rise time, and slower decay when compared with wild-type fish. Remarkably, these embryos grow to adulthood and display complex behaviors such as feeding and breeding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a mutant animal corresponding to first trimester lethality in human that has been rescued by a transgene and survived to adulthood. In the rescued fish, a foreign promoter drove the transgene expression and the NMJ had altered synaptic strength.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of 65 patients who had biopsy-proven amyloidosis and autonomic function testing between January 1, 1985, and December 31, 1997, at Mayo Clinic's site in Rochester, MN. Patients were required to have neurologic evaluation, autonomic reflex screening, and tissue confirmation of amyloidosis. RESULTS: We identified 5 clinical patterns of peripheral neuropathy: (1) generalized autonomic failure and polyneuropathy with pain (40 patients [62%]), (2) generalized autonomic failure and polyneuropathy without pain (11 [17%]), (3) isolated generalized autonomic failure (7 [11%]), (4) polyneuropathy without generalized autonomic failure (4 [6%]), and (5) generalized autonomic failure and small-fiber (ie, autonomic and somatic C-fiber) neuropathy (3 [5%]). Moderately severe generalized autonomic failure, involving adrenergic, cardiovagal, or sudomotor domains, was found in all patients, including those without clinically manifested autonomic failure. The diagnosis of amyloidosis was delayed in patients who did not have initial symptoms of pain or generalized autonomic failure (48 months to diagnosis in patients with polyneuropathy without autonomic failure vs 12 months to diagnosis in patients with autonomic failure and small-fiber neuropathy; P=.57). CONCLUSION: Physicians should test for symptoms of generalized autonomic failure in patients who have peripheral neuropathy of unknown origin. Autonomic testing may give abnormal results in patients without overt symptoms of autonomic failure. Early recognition of autonomic failure may lead to earlier diagnosis of the underlying pathogenesis of amyloidosis, as well as earlier treatment for patients with this condition.","10.4065/83.11.1226","Adult; Aged; Amyloid Neuropathies; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Electromyography; Erectile Dysfunction; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Fibers; Nerve Fibers, Unmyelinated; Pain Measurement; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Polyneuropathies; Posture; Pupil Disorders; Reflex, Abnormal; Retrospective Studies; Sweating, Gustatory; Upper Extremity; Urination Disorders; Vagus Nerve Diseases; Vasomotor System; Xerophthalmia; Xerostomia","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Despite the propensity for spinal trauma to affect the thoracolumbar spine, few studies have adequately characterized the outcomes of CMIs and CEIs. Typically the level of neural axis injury is inferred from the spinal level of injury or the presenting neurological picture because no study from the spinal literature has specifically evaluated the location of the conus medullaris with respect to the level of greatest canal compromise. Furthermore, the conus medullaris is known to have a small but important variable location based on the spinal level. Patients with a CMI will typically present with variable lowerextremity weakness, absent lower-limb reflexes, and saddle anesthesia. The development of a mixed upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron syndrome may occur in patients with CMIs, whereas a CEI is a pure lower motor neuron injury. Many treatment options exist and should be individualized. Posterior decompression and stabilization offers at least equivalent neurological outcomes as nonoperative or anterior approaches and has the additional benefits of surgeon familiarity, shorter hospital stays, earlier rehabilitation, and ease of nursing care. Overall, CEIs and CMIs have similar outcomes, which include ambulatory motor function and a variable persistence of bowel, bladder, and potentially sexual dysfunctions.","10.3171/FOC.2008.25.11.E7","Animals; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Polyradiculopathy; Sexuality; Spinal Cord Compression; Urinary Bladder","","Journal Article; Review"
"18844449","N-terminal polyglutamine-containing fragments inhibit androgen receptor transactivation function.","Schiffer NW; Céraline J; Hartl FU; Broadley SA","Biological chemistry","2008","Abstract Several neurodegenerative diseases, including Kennedy's disease (KD), are associated with misfolding and aggregation of polyglutamine (polyQ)-expansion proteins. KD is caused by a polyQ-expansion in the androgen receptor (AR), a key player in male sexual differentiation. Interestingly, KD patients often show signs of mild-to-moderate androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) resulting from AR dysfunction. Here, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the molecular mechanism behind AIS in KD. Upon expression in yeast, polyQ-expanded N-terminal fragments of AR lacking the hormone binding domain caused a polyQ length-dependent growth defect. Interestingly, while AR fragments with 67 Q formed large, SDS-resistant inclusions, the most pronounced toxicity was observed upon expression of 102 Q fragments which accumulated exclusively as soluble oligomers in the 100-600 kDa range. Analysis using a hormone-dependent luciferase reporter revealed that full-length polyQ-expanded AR is fully functional in transactivation, but becomes inactivated in the presence of the corresponding polyQ-expanded N-terminal fragment. Furthermore, the greatest impairment of AR activity was observed upon interaction of full-length AR with soluble AR fragments. Taken together, our results suggest that soluble polyQ-containing fragments bind to full-length AR and inactivate it, thus providing insight into the mechanism behind AIS in KD and possibly other polyglutamine diseases, such as Huntington's disease.","10.1515/BC.2008.169","Blotting, Western; Bulbo-Spinal Atrophy, X-Linked; Chromatography, Gel; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Humans; Immunoprecipitation; Indicators and Reagents; Luciferases; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Models, Genetic; Peptide Fragments; Peptides; Plasmids; Receptors, Androgen; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Subcellular Fractions; Transcriptional Activation; Trichloroacetic Acid","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

However, a wide range of other adverse effects, some of which may be life-threatening, may also be encountered. Side-effects reviewed here include: gastrointestinal-associated effects (constipation, hypersalivation, oropharyngeal lesions, nasal congestion, nausea, nocturnal enuresis, and urinary retention), metabolic effects (obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and hypertension), neuromuscular effects (extrapyramidal side effects, myoclonus, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and pleurothotonus), thermoregulatory effects, effects on the liver, pancreas, and kidney, sexual side effects, and effects on skin and bone. Metabolic factors affecting the incidence of adverse effects to clozapine especially are also discussed. The increasing use of atypical (second generation) antipsychotics and indeed of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has led to a greater appreciation of not only the benefits of these drugs, but also of the spectrum of toxicity that may occur in clinical practice. The adverse effects of antipsychotics are a major factor in promoting poor adherence to, and even discontinuation of, antipsychotic treatment on the one hand, and increasing the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease on the other. As such they merit recognition and either harm minimization strategies (use of the minimum effective dose, or use of lower doses of combinations of antipsychotics), or in extreme cases discontinuation of the offending drug(s).","10.2174/157488608784529251","Animals; Antipsychotic Agents; Body Temperature Regulation; Bone Diseases; Clozapine; Digestive System Diseases; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Neuromuscular Diseases; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Skin Diseases","","Journal Article; Review"

Pudendal nerve entrapment with involvement of the perforating cutaneous nerve was suspected. Suture removal 1 year after the operation resulted in improved pain symptoms and sexual function. CONCLUSION: Pudendal nerve entrapment is one potential complication of anterior vaginal repair with biologic graft. Removal of sutures, even long after surgery, can result in clinically significant improvement in pain symptoms and sexual function in patients with pudendal nerve entrapment.","10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817f19b8","Cystocele; Fascia Lata; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy, Vaginal; Mononeuropathies; Sutures; Vulva","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

We studied how this clinical information, which is readily available at the first consultation, can be used to predict the presence of SCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our study we included 52 LEMS patients with SCLC and 45 non-tumor patients (NT-LEMS). We interviewed patients using a structured checklist and reviewed their clinical records. We compared frequency and onset of symptoms during the course of LEMS. RESULTS: In the first six months, over half the SCLC-LEMS patients had developed seven separate symptoms, while NT-LEMS patients developed only two symptoms. Proximal leg weakness and dry mouth were early symptoms in both groups. Rapid involvement of proximal arm muscles (p=0.0001), distal arm muscles (p=0.0037), distal leg muscles (p=0.0002), dysartria (p=0.0091) and the presence of erectile dysfunction (p=0.007) were found significantly more often in SCLC-LEMS patients in both cohorts. Cerebellar symptoms, although present in 9% of LEMS patients, were almost exclusively related to SCLC-LEMS. CONCLUSION: A rapidly progressive course of disease from onset in LEMS patients should raise a high suspicion of SCLC. Special attention should be paid to involvement of upper extremities, involvement of distal arm and distal leg muscles, to erectile dysfunction and probably ataxia in order to discriminate between SCLC-LEMS and NT-LEMS.","10.1016/j.jneuroim.2008.05.025","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome; Male; Middle Aged","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

"18592058","Enhancing the sexual function of women living with chronic pain: a cognitive-behavioural treatment group.","Breton A; Miller CM; Fisher K","Pain research & management","2008","BACKGROUND: Chronic pain significantly impacts women's quality of life in the domain of sexual function. Treatment aimed at improving the sexual function of women living with chronic pain is minimal or absent within an interdisciplinary rehabilitation pain program. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a cognitive-behavioural treatment group designed to improve the sexual function of women with chronic pelvic pain, daily headache pain and neuromusculoskeletal pain within an interdisciplinary rehabilitation pain program. METHODS: Participants were 47 women who attended the treatment group. A physical therapist and a psychologist facilitated the group. The participants completed a modified version of the Sexual Activity Questionnaire pregroup and at one month postgroup, and a Treatment Helpfulness Questionnaire at the final group session. RESULTS: All 47 women found the treatment group helpful. Sexual function improved as evidenced by significant differences (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P<0.05) from pregroup to postgroup on measures of enjoyment, lubrication, satisfaction after sexual activity and satisfaction with frequency. Improvements occurred despite no change in pain level during penetration or fatigue level from pregroup to postgroup. Treatment helpfulness results showed that women valued the knowledge and skills gained in the group. Qualitative findings suggest that a cognitive shift, and communication and partner involvement may be mechanisms of change for improved sexual function. CONCLUSIONS: The sexual function of women with chronic pain can be significantly enhanced by a cognitive-behavioural treatment group delivered within an interdisciplinary rehabilitation pain program. HISTORIQUE :: La douleur chronique affecte significativement la qualité de vie des femmes sur le plan de la sexualité. Les traitements visant une amélioration du fonctionnement sexuel des femmes aux prises avec des douleurs chroniques sont peu nombreux, voire inexistants dans un programme interdisciplinaire de réadaptation et de prise en charge de la douleur. OBJECTIF :: Évaluer un groupe soumis à une thérapie cognitivo-comportementale conçue pour améliorer le fonctionnement sexuel des femmes souffrant de douleurs pelviennes chroniques, de céphalées quotidiennes ou de douleurs neuromusculosquelettiques, dans le cadre d'un programme inter-disciplinaire de réadaptation et de prise en charge de la douleur. MÉTHODES :: Les participantes étaient 47 femmes qui ont accepté de suivre une thérapie de groupe. Une physiothérapeute et une psychologue étaient responsables du groupe. Les participantes ont répondu à une version modifiée du questionnaire sur l'activité sexuelle avant la première séance de groupe, un mois après les séances de groupe et elles ont ensuite répondu à un questionnaire sur l'efficacité de la thérapie lors de la dernière séance de groupe. RÉSULTATS :: Les 47 femmes ont trouvé la thérapie de groupe utile. Leur fonctionnement sexuel s'est amélioré, comme en font foi les différences significatives (test de Wilcoxon des rangs signés, p < 0,05) entre les mesures notées avant la thérapie et après, pour ce qui est du plaisir éprouvé, de la lubrification, du degré de satisfaction après le rapport sexuel et de la satisfaction à l'égard de la fréquence des rapports. Les améliorations sont survenues malgré l'absence de changement quant au degré de douleur à la pénétration ou au degré de fatigue entre le début et la fin de la thérapie. Les résultats au questionnaire d'évaluation du traitement ont montré que les femmes ont apprécié les connaissances et les techniques acquises en cours de route. Selon les mesures qualitatives, certains changements sur le plan cognitif et sur le plan de la communication et de la participation du partenaire seraient des mécanismes susceptibles d'améliorer le fonctionnement sexuel. CONCLUSION :: Le fonctionnement sexuel des femmes qui souffrent de douleurs chroniques peut être significativement amélioré par une thérapie de groupe cognitivo-comportementale prodiguée dans le cadre d'un programme interdisciplinaire de réadaptation et de prise en charge de la douleur.","10.1155/2008/369382","Adult; Alberta; Chronic Disease; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Fatigue; Female; Headache; Humans; Middle Aged; Neuromuscular Diseases; Pain; Pain Clinics; Pain Management; Pelvic Pain; Sexual Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article"
"18581678","[Neurogenic etiology in patients with erectile dysfunction].","Valles Antuña C; Fernández Gómez JM; Escaf S; Fernández-González F","Archivos espanoles de urologia","2008","OBJECTIVES: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a disorder with a high prevalence that increases with age. It is estimated that 18.9% of men's between 25 and 70 years suffer it in Spain. Most cases have a multifactorial origin and it is admitted the influence on its pathogenesis of systemic diseases, different kind of drugs, psychogenic factors, cardiovascular, endocrinological and neurological diseases. Neurologic cause erectile dysfunction may have its origin in the central or peripheral nervous system. Among possible process of neurogenic erectile dysfunction of central origin would be tumors, cerebral vascular accidents, encephalitis, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis and other demyelinization diseases, dementias, olivopontocerebellar degeneration and epilepsy. Myelopathies of any etiology may be, depending on their localization and extension, cause of erectile dysfunction. At the peripheral level, disorders of the sensitive tracts constituting the afferent limb of the erection spinal reflex, and the efferent vegetative or somatic tracts mediating arterial vasodilatation, cavernous smooth muscle relaxation or pelvic floor striated muscle contraction. The aim of this work is to review in detail the most relevant causes of neurogenic erectile dysfunction, their etiopathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic approaches currently considered more adequate for each particular case. CONCLUSIONS: The correct diagnostic approach to patients with erectile dysfunction passes through identification, if possible, of the etiopathogenic factors implied. Regarding this, detection and identification of a possible neurogenic risk factor will contribute to a better understanding of the physiopathologic mechanisms, and more adequate diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches, mainly in those patients refractory to first line therapy.","10.4321/s0004-06142008000300007","Central Nervous System Diseases; Cystectomy; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Penile Erection; Penis; Polyneuropathies; Prostatectomy","","English Abstract; Journal Article"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of several agents (N-acetylcysteine, BayK 8644, glutathione, digoxin, calcium and N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester) on the recovery of smooth muscle tone after exposure to 4 h of a combination of hypoxia, glucopenia and acidosis in corpus cavernosum isolated from rabbit. RESULTS: After 4 h of ischaemia, none of the agents were able to prevent irreversible smooth muscle dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Prolonged low-flow priapism leads to smooth muscle dysfunction and fibrosis within the corpus cavernosum. When alpha-adrenergic agents fail to reverse the condition, surgical intervention is required. We showed that the administration of novel agents, including antioxidants, does not prevent smooth muscle dysfunction.","10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.07778.x","3-Pyridinecarboxylic acid, 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-, Methyl ester; Acetylcysteine; Animals; Calcium; Digoxin; Glutathione; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Relaxation; Muscle Tonus; Muscle, Smooth; Muscular Diseases; NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Penis; Priapism; Rabbits","","Journal Article"

Effective protective and regenerative neuromodulatory strategies are needed. AIM: To determine the effect of growth differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) on erectile function and its mechanism in a rat model of cavernous nerve (CN) injury. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erectile function was assessed by CN electrostimulation at 4 weeks. Penile tissues were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses. METHODS: Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six equal groups: one group underwent sham operation (uninjured controls), while five groups underwent bilateral CN crush. Crush-injury groups were treated at the time of injury with intracavernous injection of a slow-release suspension of liquid microparticles containing no GDF-5 (vehicle), 0.4 microg (low concentration), 2 microg (intermediate concentration), or 10 microg GDF-5 (high concentration). One untreated group served as injured controls. RESULTS: GDF-5 enhanced erectile recovery and significantly increased intracavernous pressure in the low and intermediate-concentration groups vs. injured controls. Low-concentration GDF-5 demonstrated the best functional preservation, as the intracavernous pressure increase in this group did not differ significantly from uninjured controls. A dose-response relationship was confirmed for the effects of GDF-5 in penile tissue. Low-concentration GDF-5 showed better preservation of the penile dorsal nerves and antiapoptotic effects in the corpus cavernosum (P < 0.05 vs. injured controls). Although high concentration GDF-5 did not confer meaningful erectile recovery, this dose was more effective at decreasing transforming growth factor-beta than low-concentration GDF-5. CONCLUSIONS: Intracavernous injection of low (0.4 microg) or intermediate-concentration GDF-5 (2 microg) was effective in preserving erectile function in a rat model of neurogenic erectile dysfunction. The underlying mechanism appears to involve neuron preservation and antiapoptosis.","10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.00881.x","Animals; Apoptosis; Blood Pressure; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Erectile Dysfunction; Gene Expression; Growth Differentiation Factor 5; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Injections; Male; Nerve Crush; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; RNA, Messenger; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Transforming Growth Factor beta","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

METHODS: A time-to-event analysis was performed using data from the Delta trial to study the incidence of PN in HIV-infected individuals receiving zidovudine (AZT) alone or in combination with didanosine (ddl) or zalcitabine (ddC). In an on-treatment analysis, changes in the incidence of PN by duration of treatment were directly estimated using a flexible parametric survival model. RESULTS: A total of 3,195 patients (total follow-up 4,593 person-years) were included in the analysis. AZT+ddC was associated with a higher incidence of PN (6.2 cases/100 person-years) compared with AZT monotherapy (3.0 cases/100 person-years) and AZT+ddl (2.2 cases/100 person-years). The risk of PN peaked around day 90 following randomization (at 8.9 events/100 person-years in the AZT+ddC arm). PN was also associated with age at entry (hazard ratio (HR)=2.35 for those aged 35-44 years compared with <30) and current CD4+ T-cell count (HR=2.27 for CD4+ T-cell counts <150 cell/mm3 compared with >350). CONCLUSION: Our findings challenge the common supposition that PN arises from cumulative exposure to NRTIs. We found that patients who developed PN tended to do so shortly after exposure to antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis of a susceptibility in a subgroup of patients. These results will be of direct interest to those working in resource-limited countries where potentially neurotoxic dideoxynucleosides are still widely used.",NA,"Adult; Anti-HIV Agents; Didanosine; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Zalcitabine; Zidovudine","","Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (N=70) with traumatic central cord syndrome who were a minimum of 2 years postinjury. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of associated SCI conditions (neuropathic pain, spasticity, bowel, bladder, and/or sexual dysfunction, decreased motor function); health status (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36], symptom satisfaction); and QOL. RESULTS: The SF-36 physical component score (PCS) was lower in subjects who reported problems with bowel, bladder, and/or sexual function (-6.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], -11.6 to -2.2). The PCS was decreased in subjects with a lower motor score and this relationship was negatively affected by spasticity and being less educated. The SF-36 mental component score was negatively affected by neuropathic pain and a lower motor score. Neuropathic pain and a lower motor score were both associated with subjects being dissatisfied with their symptoms. Subjects who had a higher motor score were more likely to have a higher QOL (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.7). CONCLUSIONS: The associated SCI conditions bowel, bladder, and/or sexual dysfunction, neuropathic pain, decreased motor function, and spasticity negatively affect the health status of persons with traumatic central cord syndrome. Diminished motor recovery was the only associated SCI condition to impact QOL. By developing a conceptual model and adjusting for confounders, an estimate for each associated SCI condition's effect on patient outcomes was obtained. Our results indicate the importance of treating or ameliorating associated SCI conditions in order to maximize physical and mental functioning.","10.1016/j.apmr.2007.10.041","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Central Cord Syndrome; Constipation; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Skills Disorders; Muscle Spasticity; Neuralgia; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Urinary Incontinence; Urinary Tract Infections","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

To mimic these injuries, we previously developed a rodent lumbosacral ventral root avulsion (VRA) injury model, where both autonomic and motor neurons progressively die over several weeks. Here, we investigate whether minocycline, an antibiotic with putative neuroprotective effects, may rescue degenerating autonomic and motor neurons after VRA injury. Adult female rats underwent lumbosacral VRA injuries followed by a 2-week treatment with either minocycline or vehicle injected intraperitoneally. The sacral segment of the spinal cord was studied immunohistochemically using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and activated caspase-3 at 4 weeks post-operatively. Minocycline increased the survival of motoneurons but not preganglionic parasympathetic neurons (PPNs). Further investigations demonstrated that a larger proportion of motoneurons expressed activated caspase-3 compared to PPNs after VRA injury and indicated an association with minocycline's differential neuroprotective effect. Our findings suggest that minocycline may protect degenerating motoneurons and expand the therapeutic window of opportunity for surgical repair of proximal root lesions affecting spinal motoneurons.","10.1007/s00221-008-1398-5","Animals; Caspase 3; Cauda Equina; Choline O-Acetyltransferase; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Minocycline; Motor Neurons; Neuroprotective Agents; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Antidepressant pharmacotherapy is currently effective in approximately 70% of all treated cases; the potential superiority of a dual mechanism of pharmacological action (e.g., inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine) is widely known. Duloxetine, a novel dual acting, selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of MDD and general anxiety disorder (GAD). Duloxetine has been found to be safe and well tolerated, with mild-to-moderate adverse events, a favorable cardiovascular and sexual dysfunction profile, and minor influence on weight gain. The efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of MDD has been established in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In addition to improving classical emotional symptoms of MDD, duloxetine has in particular beneficial effects on somatic symptoms of depression including pain. The superiority of duloxetine was shown over placebo, while comparison studies with other antidepressants showed only partial superiority. Randomized clinical trials in GAD also provide evidence for beneficial effects compared with placebo and improvement in quality of life, wellbeing and general health. Moreover, duloxetine is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and stress urinary incontinence. First results indicate that duloxetine might also be effective in the treatment of children with depression and pain. Overall, duloxetine is an interesting novel treatment option in the management of major depression and has shown efficacy in a broad range of diseases. It therefore may provide additional benefit to current therapeutic options in the treatment of psychiatric, internal, as well as urological disorders such as spinal dysfunctions. Due to duloxetine's properties, a wide range of use will be encountered in the mid-to-long term.","10.1586/14737175.8.4.527","Antidepressive Agents; Anxiety; Clinical Trials as Topic; Major Depressive Disorder; Duloxetine Hydrochloride; Humans; Pain; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Thiophenes; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Incontinence, Stress","","Journal Article; Review"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In male, it accommodates nervus dorsalis penis whereas in female nervus et arteria dorsalis clitoridis. Lateral border of sulcus nervi dorsalis penis corresponds to vertical ridge and lateral border of sulcus nervi dorsalis clitoridis to ventral arc-two parameters, which are parts of the Phenice's method for sexing of isolated os pubis. RESULTS: Exact preparation of nervus dorsalis penis is crucial in correct performance of conversion of genitalia in patients with transsexualism, in reconstruction of posterior urethra, in hypospadia, during performance of penile blockade during circumcision and in revascularization surgery of erectile dysfunction. Possible role of the sulcus nervi dorsalis penis in the Alcock's syndrome is discussed. Similarly, it is advisable to take care of nervus dorsalis clitoridis during reduction clitoridoplasty in patients with adrenogenital syndrome and during the insertion of transobturator vaginal tape. Injury of nervus dorsalis penis/clitoridis leads to hypesthesia or anesthesia of glans penis/clitoridis. The injury to arteria dorsalis clitoridis leads to bleeding and/or hematoma.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of a new compound test cumulating evaluation of autonomic and sensorymotor dysfunction in FAP. METHODS: Compound Autonomic Dysfunction Test (CADT) is a new questionnaire to evaluate the main symptoms of autonomic dysfunction observed in FAP. A separate functional questionnaire assesses the disability due to the sensorymotor deficit (Modified Norris Test; MNT). The compound test takes approximately 10 minutes to perform. In this prospective study, we enrolled consecutively 60 FAP patients to test interexaminer reliability, i.e., both questionnaires rated independently by 2 examiners. We also evaluate the reliability of testing patients face to face and by phone call, by the same examiner. RESULTS: Interexaminer reliabilities tested were high (ICC=0.92 for the CADT, p < 0.001; and ICC = 0.99 for the MNT, p < 0.001). In addition, testing by phone as compared to testing during the initial medical visit by the same investigator gave similar results (ICC = 0.91 for the CADT, p < 0.001; and ICC = 0.98 for the MNT, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In FAP, the CADT and the MNT have good reliability inter-investigators as well as between face to face and by phone call, by the same examiner. This newly designed compound test is a simple and reproducible scale which is adapted to evaluate the main neuropathic manifestations and will be useful for assessment of future treatments in this condition.","10.1007/s00415-007-0617-5","Adult; Aged; Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial; Autoimmune Diseases; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Skills Disorders; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires","","Journal Article"

AIMS: This report documents the management of a case of a plexiform neurofibroma on the penile shaft associated with erectile dysfunction. The literature surrounding VRD and its effects on the genital area was also investigated. Methods. After a complete preoperative investigation of the nature of the mass and of the erectile dysfunction, the neurofibroma was completely excised with preservation of the neurovascular bundle. RESULTS: At 6-months postoperative follow-up, there was no sign of tumor recurrence and the glans sensation was maintained. The erectile dysfunction persisted postoperatively and failed to respond to medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A complete excision of penile neurofibromas is mandatory to prevent recurrence or malignant degeneration and can be safely performed preserving the neurovascular bundle.","10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00629.x","Adult; Cafe-au-Lait Spots; Erectile Dysfunction; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Neurofibromatosis 1; Penile Neoplasms; Penis; Treatment Outcome","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

METHODS: The setting of the prospective open clinical study was the Urogynecologic Service of the Department of Microbiological and Gynecological Science, University of Catania School of Medicine (Catania, Italy). A total of 105 women underwent surgery; 42 (mean age 52.8 years) and 63 (mean age 53.9 years) were treated with TVT and TOT, respectively. Each woman underwent translabial color Doppler ultrasonography to measure the resistance index, pulsatility index, peak systolic velocity, and end-diastolic velocity of the clitoral arteries, before and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: In the TVT group, the mean pulsatility index and mean peak systolic velocity were significantly lower and the mean resistance index was significantly greater compared with the pretreatment values (P <0.5). In the TOT group, each color Doppler measurement was similar to that obtained at baseline (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: The different vaginal approach for these two surgical methods influenced clitoral blood flow. Our data could add new information about sexual behavior after incontinence treatment, particularly the impact of clitoral blood flow changes.","10.1016/j.urology.2007.04.045","Adult; Aged; Blood Flow Velocity; Clitoris; Diastole; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Peripheral Nerves; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Pulsatile Flow; Rheology; Suburethral Slings; Systole; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color; Urinary Incontinence, Stress; Vascular Resistance","","Clinical Trial; Comparative Study; Journal Article"

It is estimated that 75-150 million people in the United States have a chronic pain disorder. Neuropathic pain has a great impact on the quality of life. It is debilitating and often has an associated degree of depression that contributes to decreasing human wellbeing. Moreover, the management of chronic pain is costly to the health care system. The United States Congress has declared the present decade (2001-2010) as the ""Decade of Pain Control and Research"", making pain a national healthcare priority. In Europe, statistics provided by the International Association on the Study of Pain (IASP) and the European Federation of the IASP Chapters (EFIC) indicate that one in five people suffer from moderate to severe chronic pain, and that one in three are unable or less able to maintain an independent lifestyle due to their pain. Between one-half and two-thirds of people with chronic pain are less able or unable to exercise, enjoy normal sleep, perform household chores, attend social activities, drive a car, walk or have sexual relations. The effect of pain means that one in four reports that relationships with family and friends are strained or broken, according to the IASP/EFIC data. Neuropathic pain treatment is extremely difficult. Neuropathic pain is a very complex disease, involving several molecular pathways. Excitatory or inhibitory pathways controlling neuropathic pain development show altered gene expression, caused by peripheral nerve injury. Current available drugs are usually not acting on the several mechanisms underlying the generation and propagation of pain. Nowadays, pain research is directing on new molecular methods, such as gene therapy, stem cell therapy and viral vectors for delivery of biologic antinociceptive molecules. These methods could provide a new therapeutic approach to neuropathic pain relief.","10.2174/092986707781058913","Animals; Depression; Genetic Therapy; Genetic Vectors; Humans; Neuromuscular Diseases; Oligonucleotides, Antisense; Pain Management; Quality of Life; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stem Cells","","Journal Article; Review"

The condition affects 5% to 10% of the male population and is the most common urologic diagnosis in men younger than 50 years. Prostatitis is classified into four categories, including acute and chronic bacterial forms, a chronic abacterial form, and an asymptomatic form. The bacterial forms are more readily recognized and treated, but symptoms in most affected men are not found to have an infectious cause. Indeed, chronic abacterial prostatitis (also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome) is both the most prevalent form and also the least understood and the most challenging to evaluate and treat. This form of prostatitis may respond to non-prostate-centered treatment strategies such as physical therapy, myofascial trigger point release, and relaxation techniques. Because the various forms of prostatitis call for vastly different treatment approaches, appropriate evaluation, testing, and differential diagnosis are crucial to effective management.","10.3949/ccjm.74.suppl_3.s63","Acute Disease; Chronic Disease; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Male; Neuromuscular Diseases; Pain; Prevalence; Prostatitis; Risk Factors","","Journal Article; Review"

Periapical cemental dysplasia is a rare finding in the normal population. METHOD: A total of 55 patients with NF1, 29 female and 26 male patients, were evaluated with orthopantomograms, supplemented with periapical radiographs if necessary. The vitality of the teeth was measured by two different testing methods. RESULTS: A novel finding was the occurrence of cemental dysplasia affecting the periapical area of vital mandibular teeth in 8 adult women with NF1. Thus, cemental dysplasia was detected in 34.8% of the adult female NF1 patients, while cemental dysplasia was not present in men or children with NF1. CONCLUSION: Periradicular cemental dysplasia is indeed a new NF1 related bone lesion type. Our finding suggests that this is the first reported sexual dimorphism in the manifestations of NF1. Cemental dysplasia of NF1 patients should not be confused with periapical findings caused by endodontic pathoses. The former do not require active therapy whereas in the latter root canal treatment is necessary.","10.1016/j.ejmg.2007.04.001","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cementoma; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Mandible; Middle Aged; Neurofibromatosis 1; Periapical Diseases; Radiography; Tooth","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

These particularly concern gender, sexual identity and marriage. As a young woman, Rohima's dark skin coloration and the tumors or lumps associated with her condition led her parents and relatives to regard her as unmarriageable and in effect, despite her evident intelligence and competence, to deny that she was a woman. Bangladeshi men and women alike found her appearance a bar to any social acceptability. Even after her marriage (to a non-Bangladeshi man), her family have been unwilling to accept her and her children fully into their kinship network.

Alcock's syndrome in bicycle riders has been characterized as a prolonged glans and penile insensitivity, genital numbness and an erectile dysfunction. Although no anorectal pain or disturbance of the bulbocavernosus reflex has been reported in these patients, we assume it cannot be caused by a compression of the pudendal nerve in pudendal (Alcock's) canal, hence by a compression of the dorsal nerve of penis in the sulcus nervi dorsalis penis. In future, if clinical studies confirm our hypothesis, it might be more sophisticated to evaluate this syndrome apart from the Alcock's syndrome and term it the dorsal nerve compression syndrome rather than the Alcock's syndrome.","10.1016/j.mehy.2007.01.089","Bicycling; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Models, Neurological; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Penile Diseases; Penis; Syndrome","","Journal Article"

METHODS: A case series of 58 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of pudendal entrapment, based on clinical factors, neurophysiologic studies, and response to pudendal nerve infiltrations, is described. All patients were refractory to other treatment modalities. Patients were assessed before and after surgical decompression: degree of pain was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) score, percent global overall improvement, and improved function and quality of life before surgery and 12 months or longer after surgery. RESULTS: The primary presenting feature was progressive, chronic, intractable neuropathic pain in the perineum (ano-rectal and/or urogenital) that worsened with sitting. Other symptoms included urinary hesitancy, frequency, urgency, constipation/painful bowel movements, and sexual dysfunction. After surgical decompression, 35 (60%) patients were classified as responders, based on one of the following three criteria: a greater than 50% reduction in VAS score, a greater than 50% improvement in global assessment of pain, or a greater than 50% improvement in function and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Pudendal entrapment can be a cause of chronic, disabling perineal pain in both men and women. Since symptomatic patients seek medical care from many different medical specialists, a reliable diagnostic protocol should be established. For patients refractory to conventional interventions, surgical decompression of the pudendal nerve can improve pain-related symptoms and disability. With ongoing work on this subject, which is a difficult disorder to accurately diagnose and treat, a better awareness of pudendal entrapment across specialties will emerge.","10.1002/nau.20421","Adult; Aged; Constipation; Female; Genitalia, Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Neuralgia; Peripheral Nerves; Urination Disorders","","Journal Article"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors that influence outcome after surgery for cauda equina syndrome (CES). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CES is a rare but serious consequence of lumbar disc prolapse and can have devastating long-lasting neurologic consequences. The timing of surgical decompression remains controversial. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with evidence of a sphincteric disturbance who underwent urgent surgery were identified and invited to follow-up. The outcome measures comprised history and examination and several validated self-assessment questionnaires. RESULTS: Forty-two patients (78%) attended with a mean follow-up of 60 months (range, 25-114 months). Mean age at onset was 41 years (range, 24-67 years) with 23 males and 19 females. Twenty-six patients were operated on within 48 hours of onset of sphincteric symptoms; 5 of these were within 24 hours. Acute onset of sphincteric symptoms and the time to operation did not influence the outcomes. Leg weakness at onset persisted in a significant number of patients at follow-up (P < 0.005). Urinary disturbance at presentation did not affect the outcomes. At follow-up, significantly more females had urinary incontinence (P < 0.005). Bowel dysfunction at presentation was associated with sexual problems at follow-up (P < 0.005). The 13 patients who failed their post operative trial without catheter had worse outcomes. The SF-36 scores at follow-up were reduced compared with age-matched controls in the population. The mean ODI was 29, Low Back Outcome Score 42, and VAS 4.5. The time elapsed from operation to follow-up was not found to influence the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the symptom duration before operation and the speed of onset do not affect the outcome more than 2 years after surgery. Based on the SF-36, ODI, and Low Back Outcome Scores, patients who have had CES do not return to a normal status.","10.1097/01.brs.0000251750.20508.84","Adult; Aged; Anal Canal; Cohort Studies; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Intestinal Diseases; Leg; Low Back Pain; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Weakness; Orthopedic Procedures; Polyradiculopathy; Prospective Studies; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Sacrum; Sciatica; Sensation Disorders; Sexual Behavior; Time Factors; Urination Disorders","","Journal Article"

The reduced efficacy of treatments in this population makes novel therapeutic approaches to treat ED essential. We propose that abundant apoptosis observed in penile smooth muscle when the cavernous nerve (CN) is cut (mimicking the neural injury which can result from prostatectomy) is a major contributing factor to ED development. We hypothesize that decreased Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is a cause of ED in neurological models of impotence by increasing apoptosis in penile smooth muscle. We examined this hypothesis in a bilateral CN injury model of ED. We found that the active form of SHH protein was significantly decreased 1.2-fold following CN injury, that SHH inhibition causes a 12-fold increase in smooth muscle apoptosis in the penis, and that SHH treatment at the time of CN injury was able to decrease CN injury-induced apoptosis (1-3-fold) in a dose-dependent manner.

Spine","2006","OBJECT: Cost-utility analysis is currently the preferred method with which to compare the cost-effectiveness of various interventions. The authors conducted a study to establish the cost-utility results of routine neurosurgery-based spinal interventions by examining patient-derived values. METHODS: Two hundred seventy patients undergoing surgery for cervical or lumbar radicular pain filled in the 15-dimensional health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaire before and 3 months after surgery. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the utility data and the expected remaining life years of the patients. The mean HRQOL score (scale, 0-1) increased after cervical surgery (169 patients, mean age 52 years, 40% women) from 0.81 +/- 0.11 preoperatively, to 0.85 +/- 0.11 at 3 months, and after lumbar surgery (101 patients, mean age 54 years, 59% women) from 0.79 +/- 0.10 preoperatively, to 0.85 +/- 0.12 at 3 months (p < 0.001). Of the 15 dimensions of health, improvement in the following was documented in both groups: sleeping, usual activities, discomfort and symptoms, depression, distress, vitality, and sexual activity (p < 0.05). The cost per QALY gained was Euro 2774 and 1738 for cervical and lumbar operations, respectively. In cases in which surgery was delayed the cost per QALY was doubled. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal surgery led to a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in HRQOL. The cost per QALY gained was reasonable, less than half of that observed, for example, for hip replacement surgery or angioplasty treatment of coronary artery disease; however, a prolonged delay in surgical intervention led to an approximate doubling of the cost per QALY gained by the treatment.","10.3171/spi.2006.5.3.204","Adult; Aged; Cervical Vertebrae; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Health Status; Health Surveys; Hospital Costs; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Middle Aged; Neurosurgical Procedures; Quality of Life; Radiculopathy; Spinal Diseases; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

This article reports the authors' experience with endoscopic lumbar sympathectomies for patients with plantar hyperhidrosis. METHODS: Bilateral lumbar sympathectomy was performed for eight patients (3 women and 5 men). A retroperitoneoscopic surgical technique was used, during which the lower lumbar sympathetic trunk was resected after radiologic localization of the lumbar spine, with care taken to protect the cranial lumbar ganglia. RESULTS: All 16 sympathectomies were conducted retroperitoneoscopically, with no intra- or postoperative complications. In all cases, pedal sweat secretion was completely suspended postoperatively. After a 3- to 8-month follow-up period, the anhidrosis persisted in all cases (100%). None of the patients experienced sexual dysfunction. Five patients (62%) reportedly experienced minor compensatory sweating of the torso, and four patients (50%) had postsympathectomy neuralgia. Seven of eight patients were very happy with the postoperative results and would agree to a repeat of the intervention any time. CONCLUSIONS: Retroperitoneoscopic resection of the lower lumbar sympathetic trunk is a safe and effective procedure for obtaining suspension of excessive sweat secretion in patients with plantar hyperhidrosis that cannot be treated with conservative methods.","10.1007/s00464-005-0690-8","Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Endoscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Foot; Humans; Hyperhidrosis; Lumbosacral Region; Neuralgia; Patient Satisfaction; Retroperitoneal Space; Sweating; Sympathectomy; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article"

METHODS: Nine hundred and nine women with a history of poliomyelitis completed a survey on health, physical functioning, emotional well being and menopause. RESULTS: The majority of the sample was postmenopausal having had a natural menopause around the average age of 50.3 years; 34.7% of the sample had had hysterectomies. Thirty-nine percent were using some form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Menopause symptoms were clustered into psychological, somatic-sensory, somatic-sleep and vasomotor factors. Among never and past HRT users, there were significant differences in menopause factor severity by menopause status. Somatic/sleep symptoms were lowest in never users; past users had significantly higher vasomotor symptoms; desire for sexual activity and painful intercourse did not vary by HRT use. Compared to population estimates, post-polio women had similar rates of hysterectomies overall, but among some age cohorts they had significantly lower rates, contrary to expectations. However, they used HRT at significantly higher rates than expected. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that basic menopause characteristics of women with polio are generally similar to those of their non-disabled peers. There were few substantial differences in severity of menopause symptoms by HRT use, which is critical in light of the dearth of studies examining its risk-benefit ratio among women with physical disabilities. Until such studies provide some evidence of the specific risks or benefits to women with physical disability, each woman should carefully weigh the known risks and benefits with her physician.","10.1016/j.maturitas.2006.07.006","Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Persons with Disabilities; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Menopause; Middle Aged; Poliomyelitis; Sexual Behavior; Social Class; Surveys and Questionnaires","","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

In addition, AR alterations that generate a hyperreactive receptor contribute to the development of resistance to hormone ablation therapy in prostate cancer. AR mutations found in patients with male pseudohermaphroditism usually are missens mutations that result in exchange of a single amino acid and cause complete or partial loss of function. The molecular change underlaying spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is an extension of a poly-CAG repeat in the AR gene. The affected receptor tends to form aggregates, which damage motoneurons.

However, there is no universally accepted method of inducing nerve injury in this model, with neurotomy and crush models being used currently. To address this issue, we induced CN injury using various techniques in an effort to compare the hemodynamic sequelae of these injuries. METHODS: Twenty-five adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: (1) control: laparotomy only; (2) exposure: laparotomy and exposure of cavernous nerves bilaterally without nerve manipulation; (3) neurotomy; bilateral neurotomy; (4) bulldog crush: bilateral nerve crush with bulldog vascular clamp; and (5) hemostat nerve crush: bilateral nerve crush with a hemostat. Ten days later, a second operation was performed during which systemic mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracavernosal pressure (ICP) were measured in response to CN stimulation proximal to the site of injury. Hemodynamic endpoints assessed included ICP/MAP ratio, rate of tumescence, and rate of detumescence. RESULTS: The ICP/MAP ratio (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) in the control group was 70 +/- 4%. ICP/MAP ratios were significantly reduced in all CN injury groups compared with control group: exposure: 41 +/- 10% (P < 0.001); neurotomy: 35 +/- 15% (P < 0.001); bulldog crush: 39 +/- 13% (P < 0.001); hemostat crush: 31 +/- 9% (P < 0.0001). No significant difference existed in ICP/MAP ratios between the injury groups. Of note, the exposure group also demonstrated significant functional alterations. The rates of tumescence and detumescence were significantly reduced in all groups compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: No significant difference in the magnitude and consistency of hemodynamic alterations has been demonstrated in all CN injury models assessed in this study.","10.1111/j.1743-6109.2005.00158.x","Animals; Confidence Intervals; Disease Models, Animal; Erectile Dysfunction; Male; Nerve Crush; Odds Ratio; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","","Journal Article"

We report urinary function in 65 patients with chronic lesions. METHODS: A urinary function questionnaire was used, and neurological examination, quantitative electromyography (EMG) of the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscles, EMG assessment of the sacral reflex, and conventional urodynamic measurements were performed. RESULTS: Severe LUT dysfunction was found in 14%/15%, moderate in 27%/46%, and mild in 46%/39% men/women. Urinary symptoms interfered with daily life in 88%/92% and sexual life in 72%/67% of sexually active men/women. Symptoms of disturbed bladder emptying were the most common (95%/92% men/women), followed by urinary incontinence (56%/71%) and symptoms of overactive bladder (40%/56%). Perianal sensation was abnormal in 96%, EMG of the EAS muscle in 88%, and sacral reflex in 84% of patients. In 40%/17% men/women, a postvoid residual (>100 ml) was found. On filling cystometry overactive bladder was found in 21%/0%, reduced detrusor capacity in 9%/15%, and during voiding phase an acontractile detrusor or detrusor underactivity were found in 59%/85% men/women. Using multiple linear regression analysis, perianal sensory loss (P=0.0001) and female gender (P<0.02) had a significant positive effect on urinary incontinence score.

OBJECTIVES: To review the long-term results, complications, and predictability of outcomes of the L5 vertebrectomy and reduction of L4 onto S1 for the surgical treatment of fixed spondyloptosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Before the development of the procedure, surgical instrumentation with Harrington rods and posterolateral fusion, or fusion in situ with cast immobilization, with or without a period of bedrest, in the cast, were the alternatives for patients who elected operative treatment. METHODS: Charts, operative notes, hospital and office records, preoperative and postoperative radiographic studies, and clinical photographs were reviewed for the 30 patients who had had the L5 vertebrectomy, over the past 25 years. The average follow-up of the patients was 15 years. The follow-up was performed by the treating physician/surgeon. RESULTS: The clinical results of the first 16 patients were independently reviewed by a surgeon who was not involved in the patients treatment, at all. His independent review indicated that the patients were functioning well. All of them would recommend the surgery to other patients who needed it. None of them was taking narcotic medication on a regular basis. The follow-up of the additional 14 patients operated since that review was performed by the author. The results of the patients operated since 1994 was the same as the group operated before 1994, except there have been 2 patients who had to have surgical revision and reinstrumentation for screw fracture, although neither lost reduction, as a consequence of their nonunion and screw fracture. Both healed their reconstruction, following removal and replacement of the fractured pedicle screws and grafting of the nonunion. None of the patients has required any treatment at all (surgical or nonsurgical) for ""junctional problems"" with follow-up, now, on the earliest patients, up to 25 years. Improvement in the ""spinal performance"" of the patients, in particular the resolution of the ""crouch gait,"" which many of them showed before surgery, is particularly gratifying to them, since, for that group, the improvement in gait efficiency is particularly dramatic. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive review of all the complications in the series is accomplished in the manuscript.

Among 31 patients, including our previously reported five patients, the c.1261-10A>G splice site mutation was the most frequent mutation. Three mutations, one missense and two splice site, were associated with milder phenotype. Of particular interest, one boy had a 240 kb deletion in Xq28 encompassing CXorf6 (formerly F18), MTM1 and MTMR1 but was not accompanied by hypogenitalism. CXorf6, which have been implicated in male sexual development, was not entirely deleted in this boy, resulting in the fusion with the MTMR1 gene. A chimeric fusion transcript was detected in patient's muscle by RT-PCR, suggesting this fusion gene product avoids the phenotype.

"15716187","The vicious cycling: bicycling related urogenital disorders.","Leibovitch I; Mor Y","European urology","2005","PURPOSE: Bicycle riding is one of the most popular means of transportation, recreation, fitness and sports among millions of people of all ages who ride on road and off road, using a variety of bicycle types. It is also a readily available form of aerobic non-impact exercise with established cardiovascular beneficial effects. Bicycles are also a common source of significant injuries. This review focuses upon the specific bicycling related overuse injuries affecting the genitourinary tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE search of the literature on bicycling and genitourinary disorders was performed using multiple subject headings and additional keywords. The search yielded overall 62 pertinent articles. We focused primarily on the most prevalent related disorders such as pudendal nerve entrapment, erectile dysfunction and infertility. The potential effect of bicycling on serum PSA level was also discussed in depth in view of its recognized clinical importance. Infrequent disorders, which were reported sporadically, were still addressed, despite their rarity, for the comprehensiveness of this review. RESULTS: The reported incidence of bicycling related urogenital symptoms varies considerably. The most common bicycling associated urogenital problems are nerve entrapment syndromes presenting as genitalia numbness, which is reported in 50-91% of the cyclists, followed by erectile dysfunction reported in 13-24%. Other less common symptoms include priapism, penile thrombosis, infertility, hematuria, torsion of spermatic cord, prostatitis, perineal nodular induration and elevated serum PSA, which are reported only sporadically. CONCLUSIONS: Urologists should be aware that bicycling is a potential and not an infrequent cause of a variety of urological and andrological disorders caused by overuse injuries affecting the genitourinary system.","10.1016/j.eururo.2004.10.024","Bicycling; Erectile Dysfunction; Female; Female Urogenital Diseases; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Hematuria; Humans; Infertility, Male; Male; Male Urogenital Diseases; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Penis; Priapism; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Regional Blood Flow; Risk Factors; Scrotum; Soft Tissue Injuries; Spermatic Cord Torsion; Testicular Neoplasms; Ultrasonography","","Journal Article; Review"

Sixteen patients with SMR were treated with oral praziquantel (50 mg/kg in a single dose) and methylprednisolone (15 mg/kg/day intravenously for 5 days) followed by prednisone (1 mg/kg/day orally for 6 months). Clinical outcome was prospectively evaluated in months 2 and 6 of treatment. RESULTS: Image alterations were detected by MRI at diagnosis for all patients, and normalization or improvement was reported at the end of treatment. There was statistically significant clinical melioration at both the second and sixth months of therapy for most neurological alterations. However, the best clinical outcome was achieved when the steroid was given for >2 months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with praziquantel associated with corticosteroids was successful in all cases.

The very existence of true alcohol-related autonomic dysfunction, in the absence of alcoholic hepatopathy, is even controversial. We aimed this study at evaluating the frequency and pattern of AN in a population of heavy drinkers without liver dysfunction. We also investigated the putative risk factors for AN as well as its relationship to peripheral neuropathy (PN). Autonomic function was evaluated in 70 detoxified alcoholics and 70 well-matched controls by heart-rate response to deep breathing, heart-rate response to standing from lying position, and blood pressure response to standing up. PN was assessed by electroneurography (ENG). Detailed information about sensorimotor and autonomic symptoms, nutritional status, and parameters reflecting alcohol intake were recorded. No patients showed signs of caloric/protein malnutrition. PN was found in 74% and AN (abnormal test results in two of three tests performed) in 26%; abnormalities in at least one autonomic test were found in 62%. All patients with PN were symptomatic, mainly due to sensory disturbances. In line with this, ENG abnormalities were more evident at sural nerves. AN was symptomatic in 10 of 18 patients, and its sole clinical expression was impotence: indeed, the pattern of autonomic involvement was mainly parasympathetic. AN did not correlate with PN, nor with any parameter reflecting the amount of alcohol intake; only performances on heart-rate response to standing from lying position were related to the duration of abuse. The lack of correlation between PN and AN may suggest a different pathophysiology for these two complications. Unlike PN, AN is often asymptomatic. Among symptomatic patients (55%), erectile dysfunction seems to be the sole symptom, in line with the higher degree of parasympathetic damage.","10.1111/j.1085-9489.2004.09403.x","Adult; Aged; Alcoholism; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Cardiovascular System; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Risk Factors","","Journal Article"

Limited information suggests that androgen replacement may improve libido and sexual function among men who are frankly hypogonadal. However, the threshold for normal sexual function is in the lower end of the normal range. Increasing serum testosterone above this level does not appear to have beneficial effects on sexual functioning. On the other hand, at least among healthy men, the dose-response curve for anabolic effects of testosterone administration appears to extend to testosterone levels on the high end of the normal range or above. Small studies have suggested that androgen treatment has anabolic effects among end-stage renal disease patients, even in the absence of hypogonadism. Androgens have potential side effects, and some preinitiation and subsequent assessment and monitoring are recommended to minimize these adverse effects. Recommendations for healthy older men appear to be reasonable for patients with chronic kidney disease.

"15489353","Sarcocystis spp. in human infections.","Fayer R","Clinical microbiology reviews","2004","Sarcocystis species are intracellular protozoan parasites with an intermediate-definitive host life cycle based on a prey-predator relationship. Asexual stages develop in intermediate hosts after they ingest the oocyst stage from definitive-host feces and terminate with the formation of intramuscular cysts (sarcocysts). Sarcocysts in meat eaten by a definitive host initiate sexual stages in the intestine that terminate in oocysts excreted in the feces. Most Sarcocystis species infect specific hosts or closely related host species. For example, humans and some primates are definitive hosts for Sarcocystis hominis and S. suihominis after eating raw meat from cattle and pigs, respectively. The prevalence of intestinal sarcocystosis in humans is low and is only rarely associated with illness, except in volunteers who ingest large numbers of sarcocysts. Cases of infection of humans as intermediate hosts, with intramuscular cysts, number less than 100 and are of unknown origin. The asexual stages, including sarcocysts, can stimulate a strong inflammatory response. Livestock have suffered acute debilitating infections, resulting in abortion and death or chronic infections with failure to grow or thrive.

In the conventional open surgical technique, the use of energy sources for hemostasis is avoided to prevent damage to the cavernous nerves. In contrast, during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, electrosurgical and ultrasonic energy sources are frequently used for hemostasis during dissection of the prostate. In this study, we evaluated the acute and chronic physiological effects of various hemostatic energy sources on cavernous nerve function in the canine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 12 dogs were divided into 4 groups based on the type of energy source used for hemostasis during unilateral dissection of the NVB. The groups included conventional dissection with suture ligatures (group 1), monopolar (group 2) or bipolar (group 3) electrosurgery and ultrasonic shears (group 4). The contralateral NVB was left undissected as a control. Erectile function was assessed acutely and after 2 weeks of survival by measuring peak intracavernous pressures in response to cavernous nerve stimulation. RESULTS: Following conventional techniques of nerve sparing, the erectile response to nerve stimulation was unaffected. In contrast, the use of energy sources in proximity to the NVB during nerve preservation was associated with a substantial decrease in erectile response both acutely (74% to 91% decrease compared to controls) and after 2 weeks (93% to 96% decrease). CONCLUSIONS: In the chronic canine model, use of hemostatic energy sources in proximity to the prostate during dissection of the neurovascular bundle is associated with a significantly decreased erectile response to cavernous nerve stimulation.","10.1097/01.ju.0000139883.08934.86","Animals; Dogs; Electric Stimulation; Electrosurgery; Hemostasis, Surgical; Male; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Peripheral Nerves; Prostatectomy; Risk Factors; Ultrasonic Therapy","","Comparative Study; Journal Article"

"15245948","Nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: replicating the open surgical technique.","Su LM; Link RE; Bhayani SB; Sullivan W; Pavlovich CP","Urology","2004","OBJECTIVES: To present a detailed demonstration of a nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) technique that replicates anatomic nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP). Techniques for neurovascular bundle preservation during open RRP have undergone several decades of careful refinement. Identifying pre-existing anatomic planes and the avoidance of thermal injury near the nerves are principles considered paramount during nerve-sparing RRP. During LRP and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, the use of cautery for hemostasis during nerve dissection is common despite its unknown effects on cavernous nerve function. METHODS: We describe a combined antegrade and retrograde laparoscopic approach to neurovascular bundle dissection. The technique is demonstrated in the accompanying video segments. The use of specialized laparoscopic instrumentation, including a fine-tipped right-angle clamp and curved dissector, is discussed. The principles of meticulous tissue handling and avoidance of electrocautery are stressed. The preliminary outcomes are presented using data obtained using an abridged version of the International Index of Erectile Function and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaires. RESULTS: To date, our technique has been applied to LRP in more than 177 patients. Blood loss has been minimal (less than 300 mL), and intraoperative anatomic nerve preservation appeared excellent. On the basis of our early experience, 76% of patients engaging in sexual intercourse preoperatively who underwent bilateral nerve preservation (n = 21) reported the ability to engage in sexual intercourse 1 year after LRP. CONCLUSIONS: Our nerve-sparing LRP technique replicates established open surgical principles of anatomic nerve-sparing RRP. The techniques described here minimize the potential for cavernous nerve damage from electrical energy or heat. Early functional outcomes appear comparable to the results obtained with open RRP performed at our institution.","10.1016/j.urology.2004.02.010","Adenocarcinoma; Dissection; Equipment Design; Erectile Dysfunction; Genitalia, Male; Hemostasis, Surgical; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Postoperative Complications; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Robotics; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article"

Many older men, however, report satisfactory erectile capacity and enjoy satisfying sexual relationships. Physicians have been slow to discuss ED with patients even in the presence of multiple risk factors. New information provides strong reasons for ED inquiry and management in the primary care physician's office. The presence of ED can reveal as yet undiscovered neurovascular and psychological disorders including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, depression and anxiety as well as early neuromuscular disorders. By inquiring about ED, physicians can better decrease iatrogenic sexual dysfunction caused by certain commonly used medications. The successful management of ED, made much easier by the development of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, has additional potential benefits including improvement of quality of life for both the patient and his partner; decreasing the symptoms of depression in depressed men who also have ED; improving relationships, a significant factor related to good health; and enhancing overall patient health. Other potential values for the physician include a better clinician-patient and increased physician work satisfaction.

Recent studies demonstrate sexual dimorphism in second-messenger signaling for primary afferent nociceptor sensitization, and a role of second messengers in the models of metabolic and toxic painful peripheral neuropathies. This study tested the hypothesis that sexual dimorphism alters the severity and second-messenger signaling pathways for enhanced nociception in an animal model of vincristine-induced painful peripheral neuropathy.I.V. injection of vincristine induced mechanical hyperalgesia that was greater in female rats. Gonadectomy in the females but not the males abolished the sex-dependent difference in mechanical hyperalgesia; this effect of gonadectomy in females was reversed by estrogen replacement. Inhibition of protein kinase C epsilon (PKC epsilon ) attenuated vincristine-induced hyperalgesia in males and ovariectomized females, but not in normal females or in estrogen-replaced ovariectomized females. Inhibitors of protein kinase A, protein kinase G, p42 / p44-mitogen activated protein kinase and nitric oxide synthase also attenuated vincristine-induced hyperalgesia, but to a similar degree in both sexes. These data demonstrate an estrogen-dependent sexual dimorphism in vincristine-induced hyperalgesia (female>male) and an unexpected opposite sexual dimorphism in the contribution of PKC epsilon to the severity of this hyperalgesia (male>female).","10.1016/s0306-4522(03)00203-3","Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Body Weight; Disease Models, Animal; Enzyme Inhibitors; Estrogens; Female; Hyperalgesia; Male; Neuralgia; Neurons, Afferent; Nociceptors; Orchiectomy; Ovariectomy; Peripheral Nerves; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Protein Kinase C; Protein Kinase C-epsilon; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sex Characteristics; Signal Transduction; Vincristine","","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

METHODS: A retrospective study was made of 12 patients presenting with an abdominal wall mass, which proved to be endometrioma. RESULTS: Of a total of 297 patients of endometriosis treated in our hospital over a 7-year period, 12 (4%) had isolated abdominal wall endometriomas. Their mean age was 29.4 years. The presenting symptoms were abdominal mass (n = 12), cyclical (n = 5) or noncyclic pain (n = 7), dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea (n = 1). All patients had a history of gynecologic operations and presented, after an average of 1.9 years, with a tender mass (average 4 cm) at the previous incision site. Preoperative diagnosis was correct in 4 patients (33%) who presented with a cyclically painful abdominal mass. The others were diagnosed as incisional hernia (n = 4), ""abdominal wall tumor"" (n = 2), and inguinal hernia (n = 2). All patients underwent wide excision of their endometrioma; 2 required polytetrafluoroethylene patch grafting for the resulting fascial defect. The diagnosis was confirmed at frozen section or conventional histological examination in all patients. At follow-up, ranging from 4 months to 3 years, there was no recurrence of endometrioma. CONCLUSIONS: Scar endometrioma commonly presents as an abdominal mass with noncyclical symptoms. Imaging techniques are nonspecific and needle biopsy may confirm the diagnosis. Wide excision is the treatment of choice for abdominal wall endometrioma as well as for recurrent lesions.","10.1016/s0002-9610(03)00072-2","Abdominal Pain; Abdominal Wall; Adult; Cesarean Section; Cicatrix; Diagnosis, Differential; Dysmenorrhea; Dyspareunia; Endometriosis; Female; Humans; Muscular Diseases; Postoperative Complications; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article"

Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an unstable (CTG)n repeat expansion in the DM1 protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The affected male patients' life expectancy at birth (53.2 years) is more than two decades below that observed in most occidental populations. The DMPK gene expression is pleiotropic and includes the premature expression of several age-related signs, symptoms and metabolic disturbances including hormonal dysfunctions, progressive decrease in muscular mass, presenile cataracts, alopecia, reduced alertness, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between aging covariates and the severity of DM1 expression in 136 DM1 male subjects. DM1 clinical expression was assessed on a validated neuromuscular disability rating scale and was correlated with plasma total testosterone (rs = -0.31, p < 0.001), luteinizing hormone (LH) (rs = 0.52, p < 0.001) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (rs = 0.54, p < 0.001) levels. Following LH releasing hormone stimulation, FSH and LH concentrations increased as a function of DM1 severity (p < 0.05). Muscular disability in DM1 was also positively associated with fasting plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations (p < 0.05). The association of plasma apolipoprotein B and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with DM1 was not linear across their distribution and tended to reflect cell membrane damage progression. These results suggest that DM1, a simple Mendelian trait, can represent a valuable model to illustrate the complex relationships between variables associated with male aging.",NA,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aging; Disability Evaluation; Gene Expression; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Middle Aged; Myotonic Dystrophy; Myotonin-Protein Kinase; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Severity of Illness Index","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A regional Model Spinal Cord Injury System center. METHODS: A consecutive sample of medical records of patients with lower thoracic and upper lumbar (T7-L3) complete SCI admitted from 1979 through 1996 was systematically reviewed. Of the 306 patients evaluated, 156 subjects met inclusion criteria. The incidence and etiology of LMN vs UMN lesions were determined for the following neurologic levels: T7-T9, T10-T12, L1-L3. Lesions were classified as LMN, UMN, or mixed on the basis of the presence or absence of (1) the bulbocavernosus reflex, (2) lower limb deep tendon reflexes below the neurologic level of injury, and (3) the Babinski sign. RESULTS: The incidences of LMN, UMN, and mixed lesions in the T7-T9, T10-T12, and L1-L3 groups were as follows: T7-T9 group (7.3% LMN, 85.5% UMN, 7.3% mixed), T10-T12 group (57% LMN, 17.7% UMN, 25.3% mixed),L1-L3 group (95.5% LMN, 0.0% UMN, 4.5% mixed). Etiology of injury did not significantly influence the likelihood of a LMN lesion. CONCLUSIONS: One cannot determine the type of lesion (UMN vs LMN) on the basis of the neurological level of injury. A detailed clinical examination, including sacral reflexes, is required. This has important prognostic and therapeutic implications for bowel, bladder, and sexual function, as well as mobility.

Duplex scan was performed by posterior approach. Correlation between doppler ultrasound and arteriography was studied. RESULTS: The study of normal arteries was possible in all cases and only one normal gluteal artery could not be detected in a diabetic overweight patient. On 60 arteries, sensitivity of duplex was 100 percent, specificity 96 percent and VPN 100 percent. Significant obstructive lesions were always associated with pathological velocimetric waveform or were not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Buttock claudication can appear like a typical vascular claudication or mimic neurological or musculoskeletal diseases. It is very useful to rule out a vascular causality responsible for buttock or hip pain by simple, non-invasive and cheap exploration.

METHODS: Mass spectrometry analysis and polymerase chain reaction-restricting fragment length polymorphism were performed. A right sural nerve biopsy specimen was obtained for histological investigation. SETTING: Academic medical center. RESULTS: A 56-year-old Japanese man living in a local town (Nakajima, Japan) in Ishikawa Prefecture, a nonendemic area of type I familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, had vitreous amyloidosis, motor-dominant sensorimotor polyneuropathy, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. He had neither orthostatic hypotension nor indolent diarrhea. Restriction enzyme analysis with EcoT22 I of amplified DNA and mass spectrometry analysis revealed homozygosity for ATTR Val30Met. Of 8 family members, 5 were evaluated and found to be heterozygous for ATTR Val30Met; a family history found no relative with the similar neurologic disorders. The sural nerve biopsy specimen showed focal edema and an amyloid deposit in the subperineural tissue, associated with moderate loss of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the findings characteristic of homozygosity for ATTR Val30Met such as vitreous amyloidosis and relatively less autonomic involvements, this case had the unique findings of motor-dominant sensorimotor polyneuropathy and unusual sural nerve biopsy specimen results.","10.1001/archneur.58.11.1914","Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial; Humans; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Middle Aged; Pedigree; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prealbumin; Sural Nerve","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

The tests have, however, the potential to be of value in different interventions outside of the neurophysiological laboratory. EMG monitoring can be used for exact application of botulinum toxin by the relatively non-invasive transcutaneous approach in treatment of male detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. Checking for compound muscle action potentials of the external anal sphincter is proposed as the best method for exact placement of wire electrodes close to the 3rd sacral roots in treating lower urinary tract dysfunction by 'neuromodulation'. Presently the most established use of clinical neurophysiological techniques--outside the laboratory--as related to the sacral neuromuscular system is in the operating theatre. These tests have been introduced to identify relevant structures, for instance pudendal afferents within dorsal sacral roots, which should be spared during rhizotomy procedures for treatment of spasticity. Modified techniques are used intraoperatively to monitor the integrity of the lower sacral reflex arc (the bulbocavernosus reflex) or the lower sacral afferents throughout the spinal cord (pudendal SEP). Clinical neurophysiological tests are expected to become established in several interventions involving the sacral neuromuscular system.","10.1016/s0987-7053(01)00264-7","Botulinum Toxins; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Sacrococcygeal Region; Spinal Nerve Roots","","Journal Article; Review"

The radiological characteristics of the disc fragment were the posterior epidural location and the ring enhancement. A fenestration was performed and histologically confirmed sequestered disc material was removed. An early postoperative examination revealed that motor, sensory, urological, and sexual functions had been recovered. At late follow-up, the patient was doing well after 18 months. Sequestered disc fragments may occasionally migrate to the posterior epidural space of the dural sac. Definite diagnosis of posteriorly located disc fragments is difficult because the radiological images of disc fragments may mimic those of other more common posterior epidural lesions.","10.1007/s005860100300","Diagnosis, Differential; Foreign-Body Migration; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Polyradiculopathy","","Case Reports; Journal Article; Review"

The proband's karyotype was 46,X,dic(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.32). Despite having almost the same genetic constitution as 47,XXY Klinefelter syndrome, he was normally virilized, although slight elevation of serum gonadotropins indicated gonadal dysfunction.

The dic(X;Y) chromosome was also positive for Y markers PABY, SRY, and DYZ5, but negative for SHOX. The dic(X;Y) chromosome was also positive for X markers DXZ1 and a sequence < 300 kb from PABX, suggesting that the deletion encompassed only pseudoautosomal sequences. Replication studies indicated that the normal X and the dic(X;Y) were randomly inactivated in the proband's lymphocytes. LWD in the proband and his mother was explained by SHOX haploinsufficiency. The mother's female phenotype was most likely due to 45,X mosaicism. This family segregating Mendelian and chromosomal disorders illustrates extreme sex chromosome variation compatible with normal male and female sexual differentiation.

BACKGROUND DATA: Chemonucleolysis, decompression, discectomy, and fusion have long been cited as treatments for chronic low back pain. Over recent years newer, less invasive surgical techniques have become available, one such being ELF. Although minimally invasive, the beneficial outcome must be interpreted in relation to concerns regarding the safety of the procedure and its risks relative to those of other forms of spinal surgery. The Spinal Foundation, Rochdale has performed 958 ELFs and has collated a comprehensive database of the results of all these operations. These prospective records provided the basis for a comparison of the safety of ELF to that reported with other spinal surgical techniques. METHODS: A total of 958 procedures have been performed on 716 patients. Complications that arose during the operation and the postoperative phase of 6 weeks following the procedure were elicited from patient records. These data were correlated and compared to a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trial data of complications arising during and after conventional spinal surgery. The SPSS (statistical package for social sciences) and CIA (confidence interval analysis) statistical packages were used to draw conclusions regarding the safety of ELF. RESULTS: The cohort integrity of operation and outpatient review records at 6 weeks after surgery was 100%. In 958 ELFs performed, 24 complications occurred in 23 patients. There were 9 cases of discitis (1 infective, 8 aseptic) (0.9%), 1 dural tear (0.1%), 1 deep wound infection (0.1%), 2 patients suffered a foot drop (1 transient) (0.2%), 1 myocardial infarction (0.1%), 1 erectile dysfunction (0.1%), and 1 patient who developed panic attacks post-operatively (0.1%). This amounts to an overall surgical complication rate of 1.6%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow up of clinically symptomatic patients highlighted 8 residual disc herniations (0.8%). Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of conventional spinal surgery for adult onset degenerative disc disease and/or sciatic pain reported overall complication rates for fusion (11.8%), decompression (7.6%), discectomy (6.0%), and chemonucleolysis (9.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The complication rate of ELF is shown to be significantly lower than that reported following conventional spinal surgery (p < 0.01). From these results, we conclude that ELF as a treatment for chronic low back pain and sciatica presents less risk to a patient than conventional methods of spinal surgery.","10.1089/10445470152927982","Chronic Disease; Decompression, Surgical; Endoscopy; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Chemolysis; Laser Therapy; Low Back Pain; Sciatica; Spinal Fusion","","Journal Article; Meta-Analysis"
"11420135","Molecular basis of androgen insensitivity.","Brinkmann AO","Molecular and cellular endocrinology","2001","Androgens are important steroid hormones for expression of the male phenotype. They have characteristic roles during male sexual differentiation, during development and maintenance of secondary male characteristics, and during the initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis. The two most important androgens in this respect are testosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. Each androgen has its own specific role during male sexual differentiation, testosterone is involved in the development and differentiation of Wolffian duct derived structures, whereas 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, a metabolite of testosterone, is the active ligand in the urogenital sinus and tubercle and their derived structures. The actions of androgens are mediated by the androgen receptor. This ligand dependent transcription factor belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors, including those for the other steroid hormones. The androgen receptor gene is located on the X-chromosome at Xq11--12 and codes for a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa. Only one androgen receptor cDNA has been identified sofar, despite two different ligands. It is generally accepted that defects in the androgen receptor gene prevent the normal development of both internal and external male structures in 46, XY individuals. The end-organ resistance to androgens has been designated as androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and is distinct from other forms of male pseudohermaphroditism like 17 beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency, leydig cell hypoplasia due to inactivating LH receptor mutations or 5 alpha-reductase type 2 deficiency. Furthermore, two additional pathological situations are associated with abnormal androgen receptor structure and function -- spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, or Kennedy's disease) and prostate cancer. In the AR gene, four different types of mutations have been detected in DNA from individuals with AIS -- (i) single point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions or premature stopcodons; (ii) nucleotide insertions or deletions most often leading to a frame shift and premature termination; (iii) complete or partial gene deletions; and (iv) intronic mutations in either splice donor or acceptor sites, which affect the splicing of AR RNA. The main phenotypic characteristics of individuals with the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) are, female external genitalia, a short, blind ending vagina, the absence of Wolffian duct derived structures, the absence of a prostate, development of gynecomastia and the absence of pubic and axillary hair. Usually testosterone levels are elevated at the time of puberty, while also elevated LH levels are found. In the partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) several different phenotypes are evident, ranging from individuals with predominantly a female appearance to persons with ambiguous genitalia, or individuals with a predominantly male phenotype. At puberty, elevated LH, testosterone and estradiol levels are observed. Individuals with mild symptoms of undervirilization (mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS)) and infertility have been described as well. Phenotypic variation between individuals in different families has been described for several mutations. However, in cases of CAIS no phenotypic variation has been described within one single family, in contrast to families with individuals with PAIS. In general AIS, can be routinely analyzed and more than 150 different mutations have been reported now. Differential diagnosis of AIS is possible with syndromes presenting with almost similar phenotypes but with a completely different molecular cause.","10.1016/s0303-7207(01)00466-x","Androgen-Insensitivity Syndrome; Female; Humans; Male; Muscular Atrophy, Spinal; Prostatic Neoplasms; Receptors, Androgen; Testis; X Chromosome","","Journal Article; Review"

An association has been suggested to exist between antiandrogen-induced undescended testis and the genitofemoral nerve. Therefore, the cremaster muscles (CM) from boys and girls with inguinal hernia and boys with undescended testis were compared to evaluate the failed descent through sexual dimorphism. METHODS: Samples of CM were obtained from 10 boys and 10 girls with inguinal hernia and 10 boys with undescended testis. Sections were stained for ATPase reactions after acid and alkaline preincubations, and for the expression of myosine heavy chains. The percentages of type 1 and type 2 fibers, and mean diameters of fibers according to the types were determined for each group. Values were compared through Mann-Whitney U test, and P values less than .05 were considered to be significant. RESULTS: CM have mainly been composed of type 1 fibers. Distributions of type 1 and 2 fibers have not shown a difference among groups. Mean diameters of both type 1 and type 2 fibers from girls (P < .05), and mean diameter of type 2 fibers from boys with undescended testis have been significantly smaller than those encountered in boys with inguinal hernia (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Although the mean diameter of type 1 fibers from boys with undescended testis has been as large as those encountered in boys with inguinal hernia, mean diameter of type 2 fibers has been as small as those encountered in girls. Among various reasons to selectively diminish the size of type 2 fibers, lack of beta adrenergic effect appears to be the most satisfactory explanation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid malignancies received escalating doses of LU79553. Plasma sampling and urine collections were performed on both days 1 and 5 of the first course. RESULTS: Thirty patients received 105 courses of LU79553 at doses ranging from 2 to 24 mg/m(2)/d. Proximal myopathy, erectile dysfunction, and myelosuppression precluded the administration of multiple courses at doses above 18 mg/m(2)/d. These toxicities were intolerable in two of six patients after receiving three courses at the 24-mg/m(2)/d dose level. At the 18-mg/m(2)/d dose, one of six patients developed febrile neutropenia and grade 2 proximal myopathy after three courses of LU79553. The results of electrophysiologic, histopathologic, and ultrastructural studies supported a drug-induced primary myopathic process. A patient with a platinum- and taxane-resistant papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum experienced a partial response lasting 22 months. Pharmacokinetics were dose-independent, optimally described by a three-compartment model, and there was modest drug accumulation over the 5 days of treatment. CONCLUSION: Although no dose-limiting events were noted in the first two courses of LU79553, cumulative muscular toxicity precluded repetitive treatment with LU79553 at doses above 18 mg/m(2)/d, which is the recommended dose for subsequent disease-directed evaluations. The preliminary antitumor activity noted is encouraging, but the qualitative and cumulative nature of the principal toxicities, as well as the relatively small number of patients treated repetitively, mandate that rigorous and long-term toxicologic monitoring be performed in subsequent evaluations of this unique agent.","10.1200/JCO.2001.19.3.857","Adult; Aged; Amides; Antineoplastic Agents; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Intercalating Agents; Isoquinolines; Male; Middle Aged; Muscular Diseases; Neoplasms; Neutropenia; Thrombocytopenia","","Clinical Trial; Clinical Trial, Phase I; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

Thirty-one of 412 patients had OPT (7.5%), 10/412 PP (2.4%), and in seven of these PP was associated with OPT (7/31, 22.6%). OPT in patients with PP involved the chiasm in four patients, and the optic nerves alone in three patients. The age at the onset of puberty (or better at diagnosis) ranged from 5.2 to 7.5 yr in girls (n=6) and from 7.9 to 8.9 yr in boys (n=4). LHRH agonist therapy was used in only three children because in the others the predicted height at diagnosis was good, treatment was refused or the patients were referred to us too late. The three treated patients attained a final height within the familial range. In the untreated patients the progression of puberty was not too rapid and final height was slightly below the genetic target in four patients; however, three patients had a final height markedly below the familial range. In conclusion, the prevalence of PP is increased in children with NF1, and frequently but not exclusively is associated with OPT. Moreover, sexual precocity does not seem to be necessarily bound to chiasmatic OPT. Treatment seems to be useful in the children with younger age at the onset of puberty or with a progressive decline in predicted final height.","10.1515/jpem.2000.13.s1.841","Adolescent; Adult; Body Height; Brain Neoplasms; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Neurofibromatosis 1; Optic Nerve Neoplasms; Puberty, Precocious; Visual Pathways","","Journal Article"

The victims of bicycle accidents are usually in good health and often young. Most of the fatal head injury cases are teenagers. In this article, I have chosen four areas of bicycle trauma that frequently brings the bicycle patient to the attention of a neurologist. These areas are (1) head trauma as a consequence of road collisions; (2) compressive ulnar neuropathy; (3) impotence, probably due to compression of the pudendal nerve or its branches; and (4) lightning-related bicycle injuries. The one thing that all four categories have in common is that they are often preventable. Helmet usage and common sense would lower the number of serious head trauma cases by 50%. Compressive ulnar and pudendal neuropathies can be prevented or reduced if the cyclist would frequently change his or her position in relation to the handlebar and saddle. In the majority of cases of compressive neuropathies, the symptoms improve if the patient takes a holiday from bike riding. Lightning injuries can be avoided or lessened if the cyclist takes proactive measures to limit his or her exposure during thunderstorms. These proactive measures include knowing the climate patterns of the area and knowing where the nearest safe shelter is located.","10.1055/s-2000-9834","Accident Prevention; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Athletic Injuries; Bicycling; Brain Injuries; Child; Craniocerebral Trauma; Erectile Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Lightning Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases","","Journal Article; Review"

In a first application of this method, we studied mitochondrial particles from fibroblast cells heteroplasmic for the tRNA lys(8344) point mutation, associated with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fiber (MERRF). Individual mitochondrial particles contained between 0 and 11 mtDNA molecules with a mean of 2.0 (95% CI 1.6-2.4). The majority (75%) of the mitochondrial particles from which a PCR product was obtained contained only one type of mtDNA, consistent with the low mean mtDNA copy number. The method developed may be applied to studies of the copy number and distribution of mtDNA genomes in different cell types.","10.1006/excr.2000.4949","Cells, Cultured; DNA, Mitochondrial; Fibroblasts; Flow Cytometry; Gene Dosage; Genome; Genotype; Humans; Linear Models; MERRF Syndrome; Mitochondria; Point Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Transfer, Lys; Sensitivity and Specificity","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

We present the case of a child in whom the suspicion of abuse due to anal dilatation led to the previously unknown diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy. Myopathic involvement of the perianal musculature is a known feature of congenital myotonic dystrophy that usually appears in late childhood or adolescence. CONCLUSION: We stress the importance of considering an underlying myopathic condition in the differential diagnosis of anal laxity.

Autonomic tests showed slight sympathetic and marked parasympathetic involvement. Heart, kidney, and eyes were normal. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) mutation analysis for the transthyretin (TTR) gene was performed. The SSCP pattern suggested the presence of a mutation in exon 2, but was different from the pattern observed for a control representing the most common TTR mutation associated with FAP, i.e., TTR V30M. DNA sequencing analysis revealed an A-to-G transition in the first base of codon 28 normally encoding a valine, giving rise to a methionine residue. The presence of this extra methionine was confirmed by peptide mapping and mass spectrometry analysis. Biopsy of nerve and skin of the propositus showed amyloid deposits that were immunoreactive for TTR. This is a new variant TTR related to late-onset amyloid neuropathy with autonomic dysfunction. This case confirms that TTR mutation screening should be considered in patients with a clinical disorder consistent with amyloid neuropathy even in the absence of a family history.","10.1002/1097-4598(200007)23:7<1016::aid-mus3>3.0.co;2-w","Adult; Amyloid Neuropathies; Autonomic Nervous System; Axons; Blood Pressure; Electromyography; Exons; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Mutation; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational; Portugal; Prealbumin; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Sural Nerve; Sympathetic Nervous System","","Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
"10879757","Complications of posterior lumbar interbody fusion when using a titanium threaded cage device.","Elias WJ; Simmons NE; Kaptain GJ; Chadduck JB; Whitehill R","Journal of neurosurgery","2000","OBJECT: The authors reviewed their series of patients to quantify clinical and radiographic complications in those who underwent a posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) procedure in which a threaded interbody cage (TIC) was implanted. METHODS: Sixty-seven patients underwent a posterior lumbar interbody fusion procedure in which a TIC was used. The authors excluded patients who underwent procedures in which other instrumentation was used or a nondorsal approach was performed. Fifteen percent of the cases (10 patients) were complicated by laceration of the dura. In three cases, bilateral implantation could not be performed. The average blood loss was 670 ml for all cases, and blood transfusion was required in 25% of the cases (17 patients). The rate of minor wound complication was 4.5% (three patients). One patient died. The average period of hospitalization was 4.25 days. Twenty-eight patients (42%) experienced significant low-back pain 3 months postoperatively, and in 10 (15%) of these cases it persisted beyond 1 year. In 10 patients postoperative radiculopathy was demonstrated, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed epidural fibrosis in six patients, arachnoiditis in one, and a recurrent disc herniation in one. One patient incurred a permanent motor deficit with sexual dysfunction. Pseudarthrosis was suggested radiographically with evidence of motion on lateral flexion-extension radiographs (10 cases), lucencies around the implants (seven cases), and posterior migration of the cage (two cases). Additional procedures (in 14 patients) consisted primarily of transverse process fusion with pedicle screw and plate augmentation for persistent back pain and radiographically demonstrated signs of spinal instability. In two patients with radiculopathy, migration of the TIC required that it be removed. Graft material that extruded from one implant necessitated its removal. In one patient scarectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Our high incidence of TIC-related complications in PLIF is inconsistent with that reported in previous studies.","10.3171/spi.2000.93.1.0045","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Blood Loss, Surgical; Blood Transfusion; Cohort Studies; Dura Mater; Equipment Design; Female; Fibrosis; Follow-Up Studies; Hospitalization; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Length of Stay; Low Back Pain; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Fixation Devices; Postoperative Complications; Pseudarthrosis; Radiculopathy; Radiography; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Fusion; Survival Rate; Titanium","","Journal Article"

OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between time to decompression after onset of cauda equina syndrome and clinical outcome, and to identify preoperative variables that were associated with outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The timing of surgical decompression for cauda equina syndrome is controversial. Although most surgeons recommend emergent decompression, results in certain studies show that delayed surgery may provide a satisfactory outcome. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed to determine the correlation between timing of decompression and clinical outcome. One hundred four citations were reviewed, and 42 met the inclusion criteria. Preoperative and postoperative data were recorded. Length of time to surgery was broken down into five groups: less than 24 hours, 24-48 hours, 2-10 days, 11 days to 1 month, and more than 1 month. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between preoperative variables and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Outcomes were analyzed in 322 patients. Preoperative chronic back pain was associated with poorer outcomes in urinary and rectal function, and preoperative rectal dysfunction was associated with worsened outcome in urinary continence. In addition, increasing age was associated with poorer postoperative sexual function. No significant improvement in surgical outcome was identified with intervention less than 24 hours from the onset of cauda equina syndrome compared with patients treated within 24-48 hours. Similarly, no difference in outcome occurred in patients treated more than 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. Significant differences, however, were found in resolution of sensory and motor deficits as well as urinary and rectal function in patients treated within 48 hours compared with those treated more than 48 hours after onset of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant advantage to treating patients within 48 hours versus more than 48 hours after the onset of cauda equina syndrome. A significant improvement in sensory and motor deficits as well as urinary and rectal function occurred in patients who underwent decompression within 48 hours versus after 48 hours.","10.1097/00007632-200006150-00010","Adult; Aged; Decompression, Surgical; Female; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Polyradiculopathy; Postoperative Complications; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome","","Journal Article; Meta-Analysis"

Mirtazapine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor and serotonin-2/3 receptor antagonist, appears to cause few sexual problems. METHOD: Nineteen patients (12 women and 7 men), with SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction who were in remission from major depressive disorder (total Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D] score < or = 10), were switched to open-label mirtazapine for up to 6 weeks. Mirtazapine was titrated from 7.5 mg to 45 mg daily, as tolerated. Sexual functioning was measured weekly with the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX), and depression was measured weekly with the HAM-D. RESULTS: Eleven patients (58%) had a return of normal sexual functioning (mean +/- SD ASEX score = 12+/-3), and another 2 (11%) reported significant improvement in sexual functioning (mean ASEX score reduced from 24+/-1 to 20+/-0). All nineteen patients maintained their antidepressant response (HAM-D score after 6 weeks of mirtazapine = 6+/-3). The most commonly reported side effects (using moderate/severe rating on a symptom checklist) were initial sedation (N = 3), irritability (N = 6), and muscle soreness and stiffness (N = 3). Weight gain of 10 to 20 lb (4.5-9 kg) was seen in 3 patients (2 women and 1 man). CONCLUSION: Mirtazapine is an effective antidepressant for many patients experiencing SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.","10.4088/jcp.v61n0506","Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Adult; Aged; Depressive Disorder; Female; Humans; Irritable Mood; Male; Mianserin; Middle Aged; Mirtazapine; Muscular Diseases; Pilot Projects; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; Severity of Illness Index; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Sleep Wake Disorders; Treatment Outcome; Weight Gain","","Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there are specific symptoms, signs, and functional disability associated with adult spondylolisthesis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In spite of the common occurrence of adult spondylolisthesis, the symptoms, signs, and disability associated with it have not been analyzed in a large, well-defined group of patients. METHODS: The symptoms, signs, and disability of 111 consecutive patients with adult spondylolisthesis, before randomized treatment with fusion or physiotherapy, were compared with those of 39 patients with nonspecific low back pain before lumbar fusion. The patients completed a questionnaire covering clinical history and symptoms and submitted a pain drawing. The signs were documented. Functional disability and pain were quantified by 12-function and 2-pain visual analog scales, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of the patients reported low back pain as well as sciatica, 7% sciatica only, and 31% low back pain only. Specific signs were infrequent. A positive straight leg raising test result in 12% and an L5 sensory disturbance in 13% were the most common. The symptoms were similar in patients with spondylolisthesis and chronic low back pain, but the chronic low back pain group reported more functional disability. Patients with a nonorganic pain drawing (widespread, nonspecific pain) were more often blue collar workers; were more often and longer on sick leave; and reported reduced mental condition, sexual function, functional ability, and more pain than patients with an organic pain drawing (localized, specific pain). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical pattern and functional disability in adult spondylolisthesis and in low back pain of nonspecific origin are similar.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the neurologic outcome of cauda equina syndrome cases, in light of the significant medical implications of this disorder. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cauda equina syndrome from lumbar disc herniation accounts for up to 1% of all disc herniations. Most of the literature supports surgery within 24 hours as a means of improving the outcome. METHODS: A retrospective chi 2 analysis was performed of 44 patients surgically treated for lumbar disc herniation who initially sought treatment for cauda equina syndrome. RESULTS: In 20 patients, diagnosis was made and surgery performed within 48 hours of the cauda equina syndrome onset, including 18 patients (90%) who underwent surgery within 24 hours. In 24 patients, surgery was performed more than 48 hours after the onset of cauda equina syndrome, with a mean delay of 9 days, including 17 patients (71%) with a mean delay of 3.7 days. Causes for delay were patient-related in 4 cases (17%) and physician-related in 20 cases (83%). According to chi 2 analysis, a greater chance of persistent bladder/sphincter problem (P = 0.008), persistent severe motor deficit (P = 0.006), persistent pain (P = 0.025), and sexual dysfunction (P = 0.006) existed with delayed surgery.

In this retrospective review of 60 patients in whom ALIF was performed at their institutions between 1996 and 1998, the authors detail the associated complications and their correlation with perioperative factors. The causes, strategies for their avoidance, and the clinical course of these complications are also discussed. METHODS: The study group was composed of 31 men and 29 women whose mean age was 42 years (range 29-71 years). The preoperative diagnosis was discogenic back pain in 33 patients (55%); failed back syndrome in 11 (18.3%); pseudarthrosis in five (8.3%); postlaminectomy syndrome in four (6.6%); spondylolisthesis in three (5%); burst fracture in two (3.3%); and malignancy in two (3.3%). A retroperitoneal approach to the spine was used in 57 of the 60 patients. One interspace was exposed in 28 patients (46.6%), two in 28 (46.6%), and three in four (6.6%). Discectomy and interbody fusion in which the authors placed titanium cages or bone dowels was performed in 56 patients and corpectomy with instrumentation in four. Seven (11.6%) of 60 patients had undergone previous abdominal surgery and 29 (48.3%) had undergone previous spinal surgery. The follow-up period averaged 12+/-4 months (mean+/-standard deviation). Twenty-four general surgery-related complications occurred in 23 patients (38.3%), including sympathetic dysfunction in six; vascular injury in four; somatic neural injury in three; sexual dysfunction in three; prolonged ileus in three; wound incompetence in two; and deep venous thrombosis, acute pancreatitis, and bowel injury in one patient each. There were no deaths. The incidence of complications was not associated with underlying diagnosis (p>0.1), age (p>0.5), previous abdominal or spinal surgery (p>0.1), or the number of levels exposed (p>0.1). CONCLUSIONS: This report provides a detailed analysis of the general surgery-related complications following ALIF. Although many of these complications have been recognized in the literature, the significance of sympathetic dysfunction appears to have been underestimated. The high incidence of complications in this series likely reflects the strict criteria. Many of these complications were minor and resolved over time without long-term sequelae.","10.3171/spi.1999.91.1.0060","Adult; Aged; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Back Pain; Blood Vessels; Diskectomy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; Intraoperative Complications; Laminectomy; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Fixation Devices; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Postoperative Complications; Pseudarthrosis; Retrospective Studies; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Spinal Fractures; Spinal Fusion; Spinal Neoplasms; Spondylolisthesis; Sympathetic Nervous System; Syndrome; Titanium","","Journal Article"

RESULTS: Neurological symptoms were stereotyped associating sensory signs and sexual disorders, must of them being transient. Perineal electrophysiological examination always confirmed reality of pudendal nerve palsy. DISCUSSION: We discuss incidence, mechanism, etiology and prevention of this pudendal nerve palsy. CONCLUSION: Emergence of stereotyped perineal symptoms following orthopaedic surgery, especially after tractions on fracture table, must prevail on physicians to search for pudendal nerve palsy.

"9840068","Liver transplantation for familial amyloid polyneuropathy.","Monteiro E; Perdigoto R; Furtado AL","Hepato-gastroenterology","1998","Familiar Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP), an autosomal dominant inherited multisystemic disorder was first observed by Corino de Andrade, a Portuguese neurologist, in 1939. This disease of Portuguese origin was probably spread by fishermen, mainly to Sweden and Japan. It is characterized by a progressive peripheral polyneuropathy and autonomic neuropathy (erectile sexual disfunction, gastrointestinal disfunction, bladder dysfunction and cardio vascular disease) and malnutrition. There are neural and systemic amiloid deposits. Type I FAP, of Portuguese origin, is the most common variety. The amyloid protein is the variant transthyretin (TTR) in which methionine (MET) is a substitute for valine in position 30 (TTR MET 30). It is mainly produced by the liver (90%) and, in small amounts, by the choroidal plexus. Symptoms usually start in the 3rd and 4th decade of life and the patients usually die within 10-15 years. From the therapeutic options--plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption and liver transplantation; the latter seems to be the only one, which stops the production of TTR MET 30 in a permanent way, by means of the liver. The lack of any other effective therapy and the success of the first liver transplantation performed in Sweden arouse great hope. So far, around 300 patients have been transplanted all over the world. A hundred and thirty of them were transplanted in Portugal. A Kaplan Meier survival curve of the Portuguese patients shows a survival rate of 78% at 5 years. However, in spite of the progression of the disease being halted, the irreversibility of some neurological lesions seems to persist. This fact raises the problem of the timing of the transplantation. It seems that the patients should be transplanted as soon as the symptoms start, since mortality and severe morbidity seems to mainly involve those in whom symptomatic disease has lasted longer than six years. As the explanted liver is a morphologic normal liver, a sequential (domino) transplant has been carried out in 16 cases so far done--by one of the authors (ALF) on patients with either hepatocellular carcinoma or liver metastatic disease.",NA,"Adult; Amyloid; Amyloid Neuropathies; Female; Humans; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Portugal; Prealbumin","","Journal Article"

One-fifth of them (mostly using buprenorphine) tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); 4% were reactive to serologic test for syphilis (VDRL: Venereal Disease Research Laboratory). Condom use was insignificant while 74% reported sex with female sex workers and 15% of male IDUs also reported having sex with men. Although, sharing of injecting equipment ('works') was perceived as dangerous by the IDUs, majority of them (90/103) reportedly shared it; cleaning of works before sharing was a concern for intravenous but not for intramuscular drug injecting. Half of the IDUs reported suffering ever from abscess; a proportion (12%) of which had had superadded attack of maggots in it. They were also found to be infected with HIV (1%, 95% CI 0.028-5.97%) at a low prevalence that prompted subsequent launching of needle syringe exchange programme, establishment of cleaning norms before sharing of works, cleaning of injecting site on the body and condom promotion. To obtain baseline biologic and behavioral data on HIV risk practices among injecting drug users in India, 126 current drug users were recruited from the streets of Calcutta in 1996. 103 study participants (82%) reported injecting drugs in the preceding 6 months. Among current injectors, the median duration of drug use was 13 years and that of injecting drug use was 5 years. 90 current injectors (88%) had shared injection equipment at last use, most often with 3 other men. Although 89 (86%) of current injecting drug users perceived the sharing of syringe and needle works as dangerous, only 11% cited the danger of HIV infection. 74% reported sex with commercial sex workers and 15% had engaged in homosexual encounters; condom use was negligible, however. Serologic testing revealed a 1% prevalence of HIV, a 4% reactivity to a test for syphilis, and a 19% rate of hepatitis B. Abscess, present in 52 drug users (51%), could serve as a marker of morbidity among injecting drug users in Calcutta. Recommended, to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in this population, are a needle-syringe exchange program and interventions highlighting safer sex practices.","10.1258/0956462981922061","Abscess; Adult; Brachial Plexus Neuritis; Female; HIV Infections; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Humans; Illicit Drugs; India; Male; Middle Aged; Myiasis; Needle Sharing; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sexual Behavior; Substance Abuse, Intravenous","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome--prevention and control; Asia; Behavior; Biology; Developing Countries; Diseases; Drug Addiction; Drug Usage; Hepatitis; Hiv Infections--prevention and control; India; Infections; Iv Drug Users; Measurement; Perception; Prevalence; Psychological Factors; Reproductive Tract Infections; Research Methodology; Research Report; Risk Factors; Sampling Studies; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Social Problems; Southern Asia; Studies; Substance Addiction; Surveys; Syphilis; Viral Diseases","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Additionally, 62 male patients were interviewed on psychosocial issues, in order to disentangle the factors influencing reproductive decisions among patients affected with MD. Among male adults, significantly more FSHMD than LGMD or BMD patients were married and had children. Age specific reproductive outcome was 0.31-0.32 for BMD, 0.51-0.62 for LGMD, and 0.58-1.02 for FSHMD, reflecting the influence of the disease's severity. High RRs did not significantly diminish reproduction after genetic counselling or correlate with less prospective desire for children. Instead, early onset, severity of the disease, and past reproductive history were found to diminish reproductive outcome after genetic counselling, and prospective family planning was also found to be influenced by past reproductive history as well as by emotional/sexual dysfunction with the opposite sex.","10.1136/jmg.35.3.189","Adult; Decision Making; Family Planning Services; Genetic Counseling; Humans; Male; Muscular Dystrophies; Psychology; Reproduction; Reproductive History; Risk Factors; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation.","Bonaroti EA; Welch WC","Spine","1998","STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case report. OBJECTIVES: To illustrate the rare occurrence of cauda equina syndrome resulting from posterior epidural disc fragment migration documented by magnetic resonance imaging. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Disc fragment migration patterns are generally limited by the attachments of the posterior longitudinal ligament and its associated ""midline septum"" and ""peridural"" or ""lateral membrane."" The majority of symptomatic lumbar disc herniations are noted to be in a lateral position with resultant nerve root irritation. Although caudal, rostral, and lateral migration of disc fragments are common, posterior epidural migration of an extruded disc fragment has been reported only rarely, and only once in association with cauda equina syndrome. METHODS: The patient described in this report presented with an acute cauda equina syndrome. Investigation with magnetic resonance imaging revealed a posterior epidural mass, which was hypointense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Postgadolinium imaging showed rim enhancement of the lesion. The preoperative differential diagnosis included epidural abscess, hematoma, or neoplasm. An urgent decompressive lumbar laminectomy was performed. At surgery, the lesion proved to be a massive extruded disc fragment. RESULTS: At the 1-year follow-up examination, the patient had recovered full motor, sensory, urologic, and sexual function. CONCLUSIONS: Extruded disc fragments may migrate posterior to the thecal sac. Magnetic resonance images of a posterior disc fragment may mimic those of other more common posterior epidural lesions.","10.1097/00007632-199802010-00018","Cauda Equina; Epidural Space; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Retrospective Studies","","Case Reports; Journal Article"

"9231876","Psychological dysfunction in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy.","Ciccone DS; Bandilla EB; Wu W","Pain","1997","Patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) often present with pain and disability that cannot be explained on the basis of objective physical findings. This has led some to speculate that RSD may be caused or mediated by non-organic factors. Unfortunately, there have been few studies using standardized measures of mood and illness behavior that have compared patients with RSD to patients with other chronic pain disorders. The goal of the present study, therefore, was to compare the pattern of psychological dysfunction in patients with RSD to the pattern of dysfunction in patients with chronic back pain and local neuropathic pain. Patients with back pain resemble those with RSD in that both may report symptoms that cannot be reconciled with objective physical findings. Patients with local neuropathy, by contrast, report pain that is both circumscribed and consistent with a known organic cause. The records of 253 patients attending a tertiary pain service were retrospectively reviewed and three distinct (non-overlapping) diagnostic groups were formed: 25 were assigned to the RSD group; 44 to the back pain group; and 21 to the local neuropathy group. Using a set of stringent criteria to diagnose RSD and an analysis of covariance to control for differences in symptom duration and age, the present study found no evidence to suggest that patients with RSD were psychologically unique. Instead, RSD patients were remarkably similar to those with local neuropathy in terms of their symptom reporting, illness behavior, and psychological distress. The only exception was that RSD patients had more disability days during the preceding 6 months than those with local neuropathy (P < 0.05). The back pain group, on the other hand, presented with more diffuse pain complaints (P < 0.05) and had a greater number of non-specific medical symptoms (P < 0.05) compared to either the RSD or local neuropathy group. In contrast to previous research using less stringent diagnostic criteria, there was no evidence of higher pain scores or lower levels of psychological distress among patients with RSD. In addition, a validated survey of childhood trauma found that sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and cumulative trauma were evenly distributed among all three diagnostic groups. The burden of proof would appear to be upon those who advocate the non-organic hypothesis to provide credible evidence of psychological involvement in the etiology of RSD.","10.1016/s0304-3959(97)00009-2","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Back Pain; Child; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuralgia; Psychological Tests; Psychology, Child; Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy; Retrospective Studies","","Journal Article"

Rectal biopsy revealed amyloid deposits immunohistochemically reactive with antitransthyretin antisera. Direct DNA sequencing of the transthyretin gene of the patient showed a trinucleotide deletion in exon 4. This deletion resulted in the loss of one of two valines at position 121 or 122. DNA analysis on 11 family members at risk revealed four mutant gene carriers. Plasma transthyretin levels in the mutant gene carriers measured by nephelometry were very low. Peptide sequence analysis revealed that most of plasma transthyretin was normal with only a small amount of variant protein. This is the first report of a DNA deletion in the transthyretin gene.

These phenotypes are not specific for mutations of the AR gene, however, and defects in other genes can also result in similar abnormalities of male development. For this reason, the diagnosis of an AR defect is laborious and requires data from endocrine studies, the family history, and in vitro binding experiments. To assist in the evaluation of patients with possible AR defects, we previously employed the use of a recombinant adenovirus to deliver an androgen-responsive gene into fibroblast cultures to assay AR function in normal subjects and patients with complete forms of androgen resistance. Although these studies demonstrated measurable differences between these two groups of subjects, we did not assay samples from patients with partial defects of androgen action. In the current study, we have modified this method to examine AR function in three groups of patients with known or suspected defects of AR function: patients with Reifenstein syndrome, patients with spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and patients with severe forms of isolated hypospadias. When assayed using this method, the AR function of patients with Reifenstein syndrome was intermediate between that of normal control subjects and that of patients with complete testicular feminization. Using the parameters established by the aforementioned experiments, we found that defective AR function can be detected in fibroblasts established from patients with spinobulbar muscular atrophy and in some patients with severe forms of isolated hypospadias, including two with a normal AR gene sequence. These results suggest that this method may have some utility in screening samples to detect defects of AR function, particularly when viewed in the context of other AR assays results.","10.1210/jcem.82.6.3966","Adenoviridae; Female; Fibroblasts; Genes, Reporter; Genitalia; Humans; Hypospadias; Male; Muscular Atrophy, Spinal; Receptors, Androgen; Recombination, Genetic; Reference Values; Skin; Syndrome; Virilism","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire based cross sectional study among 260 participants in a Norwegian annual bicycle touring race of 540 km. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 160 responding males (22%) reported symptoms from the innervation area of the pudendal or cavernous nerves. Thirty-three had penile numbness or hypaesthesia after the tour. In 10, the numbness lasted for more than one week. Impotence was reported by 21 (13%) of the males. It lasted for more than one week in 11, and for more than one month in three. Both genital numbness and impotence were correlated with weakness in the hands after the ride, a complaint reported by 32 (19%) of all 169 respondents. Forty-six cyclists (30%) indicated paraesthesia or numbness in the fingers, half of them from the ulnar nerve area only. CONCLUSION: The frequency of impotence, numbness of the penis, hand weakness and sensory symptoms from the fingers in bicycle sport may be higher than hitherto recognized. It afflicts both experienced cyclists and novices. In some, the complaints may last up to eight months. Besides changing the hand and body position on the bike, restricting the training intensity, and taking ample pauses may also be necessary in prolonged and vigorous bicycle riding to prevent damage to peripheral nerves.","10.1111/j.1600-0404.1997.tb00104.x","Athletic Injuries; Bicycling; Erectile Dysfunction; Female; Hand; Humans; Male; Motor Activity; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Penis; Peripheral Nerves; Surveys and Questionnaires","","Journal Article"

A survey of 21 cases.","Pleym H; Spigset O","Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica","1997","BACKGROUND: Recent case reports have suggested that subarachnoid or epidural administration of local anesthetics may cause peripheral neurologic deficits. METHODS: To describe the course and evaluate possible risk factors of such reactions, 21 reports in the Swedish adverse drug reactions register were reviewed. RESULTS: The reports concerned subarachnoid administration of hyperbaric lidocaine (n = 9), plain bupivacaine (n = 4), hyperbaric bupivacaine (n = 2), bupivacaine with epinephrine (n = 1) and mepivacaine (n = 1), and epidural administration of bupivacaine (n = 2) and mepivacaine (n = 2). Pain in the lower extremities was reported in 12 patients (57%) and paresthesias/hypesthesias were reported in 11 patients (52%). Seven reports (33%) concerned low back pain or abdominal pain from Th9-Th10 and downwards. Urinary incontinence was reported in 3 patients, fecal incontinence in 2 patients, and erectile dysfunction, loss of sensation of full bladder and quadriceps muscle paresis were each reported in one patient. Two clinically distinct subgroups of patients were identified, one group with reversible nerve root affection which disappeared within 2 weeks and one group with apparently irreversible nerve root affection, still persistent after 1 month to 4 years. In the group with reversible root symptoms, none had motor deficits, whereas 50% had motor deficits in the group with irreversible symptoms. Possible risk factors include concomitant peripheral neurologic disease and use of other drugs associated with neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: This database study does not contain complete information for the cases reported, and a causal relationship between subarachnoid or epidural administration of local anesthetics and neurologic deficits therefore remains uncertain. The increase in the number of reports on lidocaine after the introduction of very fine-bore spinal needles is consistent with the suspicion that lidocaine at the concentration 50 mg/ml is neurotoxic and that it may not be diluted rapidly enough in the cerebrospinal fluid when injected through such needles.","10.1111/j.1399-6576.1997.tb04723.x","Adult; Aged; Anesthesia, Epidural; Anesthesia, Spinal; Anesthetics, Local; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Risk Factors; Subarachnoid Space","","Journal Article"

These sequelae must not be exacerbated during investigation and surgical repair, despite the unfavourable emergency context, associated lesions and the time required to repair them. The basic principles of surgical treatment remain urinary diversion by a large cystostomy tube for urogenital lesions, faecal diversion by terminal colostomy for ano-sphincteric lesions, conservative debridement of the margins of the anal or urethral wound, debridement and drainage of contaminated soft tissues and connective tissue spaces. First-line immediate suture of the urethra or edges of the anal wound must be considered according to the defect, and the septic and haemorrhagic context.

Genuine stress incontinence was seen in 36.3% of the survey population. Sixteen women with postpolio syndrome underwent surgical repair for urinary incontinence, with a success rate of 60.5%. Bladder disorders are common among persons with PPS, but further clinical and urodynamic data are necessary to define the nature and magnitude of this dysfunction.","10.1016/s1071-5754(96)90094-7","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Postpoliomyelitis Syndrome; Prevalence; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urinary Bladder Diseases","","Journal Article"

Androgen action is mediated by the intracellular androgen receptor, which belongs to the superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. In the X-linked androgen insensitivity syndrome, defects in the androgen receptor gene have prevented the normal development of both internal and external male structures in 46, XY individuals. The complete form of androgen insensitivity syndrome is characterized by 46, XY karyotype, external female phenotype, intra-abdominal testes, absence of uterus and ovaries, blindly ending vagina, and gynecomastia. There is also a group of disorders of androgen action that result from partial impairment of androgen receptor function. Clinical indications can be abnormal sexual development of individuals with a predominant male phenotype with severe hypospadias and micropenis or of individuals with a predominantly female phenotype with cliteromegaly, ambiguous genitalia, and gynecomastia. Complete or gross deletions of the androgen receptor gene have not been frequently found in persons with the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, whereas point mutations at several different sites in exons 2-8 encoding the DNA- and androgen-binding domain have been reported in both partial and complete forms of androgen insensitivity, with a relatively high number of mutations in two clusters in exons 5 and 7. The number of mutations in exon 1 is extremely low, and no mutations have been reported in the hinge region, located between the DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain. The X-linked condition of spinal and bulbar muscle atrophy (Kennedy's disease) is characterized by a progressive motor neuron degeneration associated with signs of androgen insensitivity and infertility. The molecular cause of spinal and bulbar muscle atrophy is an expanded length (> 40 residues) of one of the polyglutamine stretches in the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor.","10.1016/0039-128x(96)00008-6","Amino Acid Sequence; Androgen-Insensitivity Syndrome; Female; Humans; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Motor Neuron Disease; Muscular Atrophy, Spinal; Mutation; Receptors, Androgen; Syndrome","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review"

The mean hormonal levels +/-SD were: LH 8.0 +/- 4.4 mIU/ml, FSH 17.4 +/- 11.5 mIU/ml, A 200 +/- 130 ng/dl (all higher than in controls); T 406 +/- 290 ng/dl, FT 22.7 +/- 7.0 pg/ml, DHT 55.5 +/- 29.7 ng/ml (all lower than in controls). The low FT and DHT levels (never previously studied in MD) confirm the androgenic deficiency. The high androstenedione levels and low testosterone concentrations suggest defective enzyme 17-dehydrogenase. The duration of the disease correlated with both testosterone (r = -0.56) and FT levels (r = -0.59), showing that hypogonadism tends to worsen progressively. When the patients were divided into three groups on the basis of the severity of muscle involvement (A, B and C), LH and FSH levels were higher in group C (more severe disease) than in group A, respectively 9.3 +/- 4.7 and 20.6 +/- 12.3 mIU/ml versus 4.8 +/- 0.9 and 8.4 +/- 3.8, p < 0.03; T levels were lower in group C than in group A, 337.3 +/- 263.4 ng/dl versus 649.7 +/- 320.3 (p < 0.03); however, there was no significant difference in the FT levels of the three groups, which may imply that hypogonadism is unlikely to have a direct effect on muscle atrophy. About 25% of our patients were impotent; these subjects had higher LH and FSH (p < 0.001) and lower FT levels than the patients who were not impotent (p < 0.03). However, hypogonadism may not be the only cause of impotence as all of the impotent patients belonged to group C and had a very high (CTG)n triplet expansion. We hypothesise that hypogonadism and sexual impairment could be partially due to a muscle cell alteration: i.e. a dysfunction of both the testicular peritubular myoid cells and of the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle.","10.1007/BF01995710","Adult; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Humans; Hypogonadism; Luteinizing Hormone; Male; Middle Aged; Myotonic Dystrophy; Testosterone","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

MATERIAL: 4 sportive patients, 26 to 41 years old have been treated surgically after an average of one year and a half of evolution and failure of conservative treatments. The surgical procedure consisted in section of the piriformis muscle and neurolysis of the sciatic nerve. METHODS: The follow-up ranged from one year and a half. The observations were confronted with 11 english language publications, representing 20 observations. RESULT: 2 excellent results. One fair. The result of the last patient is uninterpreted due to a post-operative deficiency of the inferior gluteus nerve. But the pre-operative symptomatology has completely disappeared. DISCUSSION: Symptomatology associated a trunked sciatalgy arising during effort and during a long time sitting position, without lumbar pain. Paresthesy and dyspareunia can sometimes added. The specifics clinical signs are pain induced by palpation at the sacrum lateral edge, perception of a tense piriformis (""sausage shaped mass""), pain reproduction by stretching the piriformis (Freiberg) or by its opposite tensing (Pace and Nagle, Beatty). The complementary exams first allow to eliminate all rachidian or discal aetiology. The diagnosis is based on CT, MRI and bone scan which can show modifications of the piriformis muscle and especially the electrommyogram which confirms the syndrome and specifies the compression level. The aetiology is changeable, mainly represented by modification of piriformis (hypertrophy, contracture or micro traumatisms due to sport or after-effects of direct traumatism) and by anatomical modifications of the sciatic nerve, passing completely or in part through the muscle. First, the treatment must be conservative by sport rest, correction of occupational diseases, local injections and especially stretchings. The results are more often favourable. In case of failure and diagnosis certitude, the surgical treatment is the neurolysis of the sciatic nerve and the muscle section at the musculo-tendinous junction. CONCLUSION: This syndrome must be known but, in spite of its proved authenticity now, must stay an exceptional diagnosis and be based on irrefutable criteria.",NA,"Adult; Athletic Injuries; Buttocks; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Sciatic Nerve; Sciatica","","Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article"

However, the effects of this procedure on the nerves of the pelvic plexus and erectile dysfunction remain unaddressed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of laser energy on extent of prostatic damage as well as injury to periprostatic cavernosal nerves and erectile dysfunction in a canine model. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six adult male mongrel dogs underwent transurethral laser prostatectomy at 30 (n = 3) and 40 (n = 3) watt power settings. Total laser energy delivered varied between 6,000 and 13,800 joules. Erectile function was evaluated by pelvic nerve stimulation at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Animals were then sacrificed to assess histopathology of the prostate at each time point. RESULTS: Histopathologic changes were noted in the prostate in a dose-dependent manner and did not vary with different laser power settings. In dogs that received approximately 10,000 J, substantial prostate ablation confined within the capsule was achieved in every prostate gland. Adequate erectile responses were noted in five of six animals; all received < 10,000 J. In one animal that received a total dose of 13,800 J, an erectile response was not obtained, and histology revealed both prostatic capsule perforation in close proximity to the cavernous nerves and thermal neural damage. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that cavernous nerve damage may result from excessive doses of laser energy during transurethral laser treatment of the prostate gland. In canines, the upper limit for periprostatic injury is between 10 and 14,000 joules.","10.1002/lsm.1900170405","Aluminum Silicates; Animals; Dogs; Electric Stimulation; Erectile Dysfunction; Hypogastric Plexus; Laser Therapy; Male; Neodymium; Penile Erection; Penis; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Prostate; Prostatectomy; Yttrium","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

DESIGN: A multicentre open-label study. SETTING: Australian public hospital system. SUBJECTS: A total of 235 homo-/bisexual men with ARC were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: All subjects received 1200 mg zidovudine daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival, incidence and time to development of AIDS and to development of haematological and clinical side-effects. RESULTS: Median time to development of AIDS was 61 weeks, significantly longer (P < 0.03) than the median of 22 weeks in a small control group of 12 untreated ARC subjects. Median survival from development of AIDS was 48 weeks, marginally longer than the 44 weeks in untreated historical AIDS controls. Anaemia requiring transfusion occurred in 113 subjects (48%). Significant differences in time to development of AIDS were found in favour of subjects not requiring transfusions (P < 0.001) with no weight loss (P = 0.004), and who received the full zidovudine dose (1200 mg) during the first 52 weeks of treatment (P = 0.021). Significantly longer median survival times from commencement of zidovudine were found in subjects with a baseline Karnofsky score > or = 90, baseline Hb > or = 13 g/dl, baseline CD4+ cell count > or = 50 x 10(6)/l, no weight loss during first year of treatment, and no or not more than one blood transfusion during treatment. The ability to tolerate full-dose zidovudine was best predicted by a baseline Hb > or = 13 g/dl. Zidovudine-intolerant subjects (defined as the development of either anaemia requiring transfusions, WCC 1000 x 10(6)/l or zidovudine-related myopathy) had a significantly shorter time to development of AIDS than zidovudine-tolerant subjects (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Zidovudine may benefit people with ARC by significantly postponing the development of AIDS. This benefit appears to be greater in those who do not develop clinical intolerance whilst receiving zidovudine. However, administration of zidovudine to subjects with ARC does not appear to contribute to improved survival after the development of AIDS. People with ARC who develop AIDS while receiving zidovudine, or who develop intolerance to zidovudine, should be considered immediately eligible for other antiretroviral therapies.","10.1097/00002030-199405000-00008","AIDS-Related Complex; AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adult; Aged; Anemia; Australia; Bisexuality; Homosexuality; Humans; Life Tables; Likelihood Functions; Male; Middle Aged; Muscular Diseases; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Safety; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Zidovudine","","Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphorus (PCr/Pi) ratios in the resting calf muscle, obtained using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), were very low during the state of muscle weakness, while they returned to nearly normal values after clinical improvement, suggesting that the muscle weakness in hypernatremic state was caused by a depletion of the intramuscular energy stores, probably due to an overworking Na-K pump to correct the intracellular electrolyte imbalance.","10.1016/0022-510x(94)90291-7","Adult; Diagnosis, Differential; Energy Metabolism; Fluid Therapy; Humans; Hypernatremia; Hypopituitarism; Hypothalamic Neoplasms; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Muscular Diseases; Polymyositis; Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase; Thirst","","Case Reports; Journal Article; Review"

"8166577","Pudendal canal decompression in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.","Shafik A","Archives of andrology","1994","The results of the treatment of 7 patients with neurogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) by pudendal canal decompression are presented. Ages ranged from 46 to 56 years. Patients had penile, perineal, and scrotal hypoesthesia or anesthesia. EMG of the external urethral sphincter and levator ani muscle revealed diminished activity. There were increased bulbocavernosus and pudendal nerve terminal motor (PNTML) latencies. Patients tested normal for endocrine assays, Doppler examination of the penile arteries penobrachial pressure index, and cavernosometry. Nocturnal penile tumescence activity was absent. These findings pointed to neurogenic ED due to pudendal canal syndrome (PCS). Pudendal canal decompression was done through a para-anal incision. The inferior rectal nerve was followed to the pudendal nerve in the pudendal canal, which was slit open. Mean followup was 19.6 months. No complications were encountered. ED improved in 6 of the 7 patients 2-6 months postoperatively. Sensory and motor changes also improved. It is suggested that chronic straining at stool in these patients led to levator subluxation and sagging, and to pulling on the pudendal nerve with a resulting entrapment in the pudendal canal, pudendal neuropathy, and PCS. ED results from involvement of the penile and perineal branches of the pudendal nerve. To conclude, PCS may cause ED, which improves with pudendal canal decompression.","10.3109/01485019408987779","Adult; Electromyography; Erectile Dysfunction; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Penile Erection; Penis","","Journal Article"

Evoked external urethral sphincter potentials by conus medullaris stimulation were measured both before walking and after walking in five patients who complained of sexual organ or urinary dysfunction during walking, and were compared with simultaneously induced sacral nerve symptoms. These potentials were also measured during surgery. Sacral nerve symptoms were reproduced by walking 80-350 meters (average 177.5 m). These potentials disappeared in one patient and were decreased in four patients at the time when the claudicant symptoms disabled the patient during walking.

While human intestinal sarcocystosis has not been reported in Malaysia so far, it can be assumed that such cases may not be infrequent in view of the occurrence of Sarcocystis cysts in meat animals, such as buffalo. The overall seroprevalence of 19.8% reported among the main racial groups in Malaysia indicates that sarcocystosis (both the intestinal and muscular forms) may be emerging as a significant food-borne zoonotic infection in the country.",NA,"Animals; Antibodies, Protozoan; Food Parasitology; Humans; Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic; Malaysia; Muscular Diseases; Prevalence; Sarcocystis; Sarcocystosis; Zoonoses","","Journal Article; Review"

Although the initiation of a subsequent link is normally dependent on achievement of the previous link, each link has its own mechanisms, and can be made to occur in isolation. The basic requirements for ejaculation are the production of seminal fluid (mostly from the seminal vesicles) and its propulsion. The production of a normal volume of seminal fluid requires the presence of seminal vesicles and the maintenance of their secretion by androgens. The propulsion of seminal fluid is in 3 phases: I. Contraction of seminal vesicles; II. Closure of bladder neck (both due to T9-L2 sympathetic stimulation); III. Expulsion of semen from the bulb of the urethra (due to S2-S3 somatic stimulation). The coordination of these phases is probably at hypothalamic level. Failure of ejaculation may be classified into I.

Symptoms of PPOD, and indicators of LSNRC were assessed prior to the onset, and following the termination of treatment.

DESIGN--Two year prospective follow up study of electrophysiological measurements in subjects positive for HIV antibody but without AIDS. SETTING--HIV screening clinic and clinical departments in a university hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. SUBJECTS--Twelve homosexual men positive for HIV antibody who had not developed AIDS. RESULTS--Eight latencies were measured: from the ankle to T12, the wrist to C7, T12 to the cerebral cortex, C7 to the cerebral cortex, the ankle to the gluteal crease (tibial nerve), the gluteal crease to T12, the wrist to Erb's point (median nerve), and Erb's point to C7.

Although the prognosis is favourable and full recovery is usually observed, the disabling effect of the neuropathy may last for several months. This report is an attempt to alert fertility surgeons to the possible occurrence of such a complication disturbing to both patient and physician, by analysing the mechanisms of injury and possible ways of its prevention. The possibility of bilateral femoral neuropathy after microsurgical tuboplasty for the reversal of sterilization is possible. There seems to be little awareness of this condition by gynecologists and fertility surgeons. This type of femoral neuropathy has an excellent prognosis and only physiotherapy is necessary to aid muscular function. Some cases have been reported where recovery has been extremely slow, normal functions had taken months, and some disability lasted years. The femoral nerve is not included in the pelvis, therefore injury through operative procedures are unlikely. The self-retaining retractors were used in all reported cases and verified through clinical experience. There are 2 types of injury to the femoral nerve: Direct pressure on the nerve itself by retractor blades, and impingement of the psoas muscle and the nerve against the lateral pelvic muscle. Factors that increase the possibility of this condition include diabetes mellitus, rheumatism, gout, alcoholism, malnutrition, syphilis, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, tetanus, liver abscesses, sepsis of distal parts of the body, polyarteritis nodosa, anticoagulants, and bleeding diseases. Femoral neuropathy has been observed after using self-retaining retractors such as O'Connor, O'Sullivan, Mann, Collin and Balfour.

"3025581","Neurology of sex steroids and oral contraceptives.","Schipper HM","Neurologic clinics","1986","Under normal circumstances, sex steroids interact with diverse neural substrates to modulate a host of activities essential to the preservation of the individual and the species. In addition, sex hormones play an important role in various human neurologic conditions including strokes, migraine, certain movement disorders and peripheral neuropathies, and possibly even the behavior of CNS neoplasms. This review of the effects of sex steroids and oral contraceptives (OCs) on neurologic function in health and disease covers the following: sex steroids and their interaction with neural tissues; the human menstrual cycle and OCs; and sex hormones and OCs in human neurologic disease, i.e., stroke (thromboembolic cerebral infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, vascular malformations, and cerebral venous thrombosis), migraine, movement disorders, nervous system neoplasm, and the peripheral nerve. The various sex hormones may exert their effects on the nervous system directly or undergo conversion to more active metabolites. Interactions of sex hormones with neural substrates subserve numerous activities essential to both the well-being and perpetuation of the individual and the species. These interactions are key to the sexual differentiation of the brain, control of the brain-pituitary-gonad axis, and to the establishment of normal patterns of sexual and aggressive behavior in both sexes. Additionally, they play a role in temperature regulation (progesterone), caloric homeostasis (estrogen), and possibly sensory discrimination. The potent influences exerted by sex steroids on catecholamine and indoleamine turnover and the colocalization of labeled E2 within catecholamine and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) positive perikarya suggest that many of the physiologic effects of sex steroids are mediated by modulation of specific monoaminergic and peptidergic pathways. Estrogens and aromatizable androgens also induce irreversible structural alterations in the rodent hypothalamus during the neonatal and peripubertal periods that are predominantly synaptogenic. In adult mammals, estrogens induce pathologic changes in the hypophysiotropic hypothalamus that may contribute to reproductive senescence in some species. Data from a series of retrospective and prospective studies have implicated OC use as an independent risk factor for the development of hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic stroke. Hormonal changes accompanying the pregnant state and the estrogen (and possibly progestogen) content of OCs may be predisposing factors in thromboembolic cerebral infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, and bleeding from intracranial and spinal vascular malformations. There are well-documented temporal associations of migrainous headache with specific phases of the menstrual cycle and the modifying influences of pregnancy, the menopause, and OC use. Also well established are relationships between endogenous and exogenous sex hormones and chorea. Fluctuating sex steroids also influence neuropsychiatric states, such depression and neuroendocrine disorders.",NA,"Animals; Basal Ganglia Diseases; Brain; Brain Diseases; Brain Neoplasms; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal; Female; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Menstrual Cycle; Migraine Disorders; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases","Androgens--side effects; Biology; Cardiovascular Effects; Central Nervous System; Central Nervous System Effects; Cerebrovascular Effects; Chorea; Clinical Research; Contraception; Contraceptive Agents; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Contraceptive Methods--side effects; Corpus Luteum Hormones--side effects; Depression; Diseases; Economic Factors; Endocrine System; Estrogens--side effects; Family Planning; Headache; Hormones--side effects; Literature Review; Menstrual Cycle; Menstruation; Mental Disorders; Migraine; Neoplasms; Neurologic Effects; Oral Contraceptives--side effects; Physiology; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Progestational Hormones; Progesterone--side effects; Reproduction; Reproductive Control Agents; Research And Development; Research Methodology; Signs And Symptoms; Technology; Thromboembolism; Thrombosis; Vascular Diseases","Journal Article"

The second mode of presentation (twenty-one patients) was a slower onset, characterized by prior symptoms for varying time-intervals before the more gradual onset of the cauda equina syndrome. All patients had urinary retention preoperatively. Bladder function was the most seriously affected function preoperatively and remained so postoperatively. The prognosis for return of motor function was good, since twenty-seven of the thirty patients who were operated on regained normal motor function. Preoperatively all patients had sciatica, which was bilateral in fourteen and unilateral in seventeen. The average time to surgical decompression after the patient was seen ranged from 1.1 days for the more acute lesions to 3.3 days for the second group.

Sexual and bladder function before and after surgery with respect to the surgical procedure was considered. 221 patients gave suitable information about their urinary function: bladder dysfunction was observed in 20% of amputated patients as against 13-14% of resected patients. 144 patients (103 males and 41 females) were available for a follow-up study of the sexual function.

Clinical tests (bulbocavernous reflex, perineal reflexes) are often inadequate and urodynamic investigations (cystomanometry, urecholine test, Susset's test) are sometimes unhelpful. The integrity of this structure is essential for normal sphincter function and disease at this level (or of its afferent or efferent limbs) produces a peripheral type of disorder. Sacral evoked potentials are an electrophysiological means of testing the bulbocavernous reflex by external stimulation of the dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris and recording by a needle bipolar electrode in the striated muscle of the sphincter or the bulbocavernous muscle. An objective study of the sacral reflex are (S2, S3, S4) can thus be performed. One hundred and ten patients have undergone this investigation. Normal latency established in a series of 26 healthy volunteers was less than 42.1 ms. Prolongation of this interval is a sign of disease of the reflex are and correlated with urinary or sexual problems in 46 cases of clinical or electrical peripheral neuropathy.

We recovered HTLV-III from at least one specimen from 24 of 33 patients with AIDS-related neurologic syndromes. In one patient, HTLV-III was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid during acute aseptic meningitis associated with HTLV-III seroconversion. HTLV-III was also isolated from cerebrospinal fluid from six of seven patients with AIDS or its related complex and unexplained chronic meningitis. In addition, of 16 patients with AIDS-related dementia, 10 had positive cultures for HTLV-III in cerebrospinal fluid, brain tissue, or both. Furthermore, we cultured HTLV-III from the spinal cord of a patient with myelopathy and from the sural nerve of a patient with peripheral neuropathy. These findings suggest that HTLV-III is neurotropic, is capable of causing acute meningitis, is responsible for AIDS-related chronic meningitis and dementia, and may be the cause of the spinal-cord degeneration and peripheral neuropathy in AIDS and AIDS-related complex.","10.1056/NEJM198512123132401","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Acute Disease; Adult; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Chronic Disease; Deltaretrovirus; Dementia; Homosexuality; Humans; Male; Meningitis; Middle Aged; Nerve Tissue; Nervous System Diseases; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Spinal Cord Diseases; Syndrome","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Americas; Biology; Central Nervous System; Central Nervous System Effects; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Diseases; Hiv Infections; Neurologic Effects; North America; Northern America; Physiology; United States; Viral Diseases","Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

Of an initial unselected group of 318 patients, 124 (39%) were neurologically symptomatic, and one-third already had their neurological complaints at the time of presentation. An additional 210 AIDS patients with neurological symptoms have been reported in the literature. Thus, a total of 366 neurologically symptomatic patients with AIDS or lymphadenopathy are reviewed. Central nervous system (CNS) complications, encountered in 315 patients, included the following viral syndromes: subacute encephalitis (54), atypical aseptic meningitis (21), herpes simplex encephalitis (nine), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (six), viral myelitis (three), and varicella-zoster encephalitis (one). Non-viral infections were caused by Toxoplasma gondii (103), Cryptococcus neoformans (41), Candida albicans (six), Mycobacteria (six), Treponema pallidum (two), coccidioidomycosis (one), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (one), Aspergillus fumigatus (one), and Escherichia coli (one). Neoplasms included primary CNS lymphoma (15), systemic lymphoma with CNS involvement (12), and metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma (three). Cerebrovascular complications were seen in four patients with hemorrhage and five with infarction. Five patients in the UCSF series had multiple intracranial pathologies, including two cases of simultaneous Toxoplasma gondii infections and primary CNS lymphoma, two cases of coexistent Toxoplasma gondii and viral infections, and one case of combined Toxoplasma gondii and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cranial or peripheral nerve complications, seen in 51 patients, included cranial nerve syndromes secondary to chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (five), lymphoma (five), and Bell's palsy (five). Peripheral nerve syndromes included chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (12), distal symmetrical neuropathy (13), herpes zoster radiculitis (six), persistent myalgias (two), myopathy (two), and polymyositis (one). In light of the protean behavior of AIDS and the problems related to the clinical, radiological, and serological diagnosis of the unusual and varied associated nervous system diseases, patients with AIDS and neurological complaints require a rigorous and detailed evaluation. The authors' experience suggests that biopsy of all CNS space-occupying lesions should be performed for tissue diagnosis prior to the institution of other therapies.","10.3171/jns.1985.62.4.0475","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Antineoplastic Agents; Bacterial Vaccines; Brain Neoplasms; Candidiasis; Central Nervous System Diseases; Cranial Nerve Diseases; Cryptococcosis; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Deltaretrovirus; Encephalitis; Herpes Simplex; Homosexuality; Humans; Interferon Type I; Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal; Lymphoma; Male; Meningitis; Mycobacterium Infections; Nervous System Diseases; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Retroviridae Infections; Sarcoma, Kaposi; Skin Neoplasms; Spinal Cord Neoplasms; Toxoplasmosis; Transfusion Reaction","","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Review"

Alterations in carbohydrate metabolism are often associated with neuromuscular disorders. We performed oral glucose tolerance tests and insulin binding studies on erythrocytes from 17 DMD and 8 normal males. Furthermore, we measured insulin binding to erythrocytes from 12 normal males and from 11 mothers and 10 sisters of affected males. As a group, DMD patients had mild glucose intolerance and both fasting and postabsorptive marked hyperinsulinemia (insulin resistance). Levels of glucose and insulin, expressed as incremental areas under their respective curves, were significantly elevated in the wheelchair-ridden patients. Incremental areas of glucose (0-2 h) and insulin (0-5 h) were 42 +/- 5 mg/dl X h (mean +/- SEM) and 96 +/- 18 microU/ml X h, respectively, in normal subjects and 71 +/- 6 (P less than 0.05) and 206 +/- 30 (P less than 0.05), respectively, in the wheelchair-confined DMD patients. All of the ambulatory DMD males had normal oral glucose tolerance tests. Insulin binding to erythrocytes was 20-30% lower (P less than 0.01) in all DMD patients than in normal males appropriately matched for age and degree of sexual development. This difference in binding was a result of lower affinity of the insulin receptor in DMD erythrocytes. On the other hand, insulin binding to fibroblasts was the same in normal males and DMD patients, suggesting that the abnormality of erythrocyte binding in DMD is probably not genetically induced. Insulin binding to erythrocytes and monocytes was the same in all females studied, regardless of whether they were carriers of the DMD gene. Our results suggest that abnormal insulin binding in DMD erythrocytes is an acquired rather than genetic abnormality, but insulin binding is not helpful in the identification of carrier females. The defect in insulin binding in DMD is present before the development of insulin resistance, which occurs only in severely immobilized patients. Thus, the cause of the insulin resistance in DMD may reside at steps beyond the binding of insulin to its receptor.","10.1210/jcem-60-2-320","Adult; Cells, Cultured; Child; Erythrocytes; Female; Fibroblasts; Glucose Tolerance Test; Heterozygote; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Male; Monocytes; Muscular Dystrophies; Receptor, Insulin","","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The main principle is the routine search of these effects which are not always spontaneously mentioned by the patients, especially intellectual slowness and loss of sexual activity. The detection of the side effects through history and physical examination is far more fruitful than are plasma concentrations of drugs which can be doubly misleading: some plasma concentrations lower than recognized therapeutical levels are efficient however while others are higher and nevertheless necessary and well tolerated. Among the side effects specific to certain antiepileptic drugs, shoulder-hand syndrome due to phenobarbital was noted in 10 per cent of the cases.
